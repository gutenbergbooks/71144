<p class="drop-cap">S<span class="smcap">uch</span> is the picture of this month, drawn
by an old English poet. With us the
heat is still greater than in England;
yet the farmers keep busily at work
in the fields; and, to say truth, it is about
as comfortable to be at work, as to be
idle.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt, speaking of this month in
England, says, “The heat in this month
is greatest on account of its duration.
There is a sense of heat and quiet all
over nature. The birds are silent. The
little brooks are dried up. The earth is
parched. The shadows of the trees are
particularly grateful, heavy and still.
The oaks, which are freshest, because
latest in leaf, form noble, clumpy canopies,
looking, as you lie under them, of
a strong emulous green, against the blue
sky. The traveller delights to cut across
the country, through the fields and the
leafy lanes, where nevertheless the flints
sparkle with heat. The cattle get into
the shade, or stand in the water. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
active and air-cutting swallows, now beginning
to assemble for migration, seek
their prey among the shady places, where
the insects, though of differently compounded
natures, ‘fleshless and bloodless,’
seem to get for coolness, as they do
at other times for warmth. The sound of
insects is likewise the only audible sound
now, increasing rather than lessening
the sense of quiet by its gentle contrast.
The bee now and then sweeps across the
ear with his gravest tone. The gnats</p>

<p class="center">
‘Their murmuring mall trumpets sounden wide,’<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">and here and there, the little musician

<p>“Besides some of the flowers of the last
month, there are candy-tufts, catch-fly,
columbines, egg plant, French marigold,
lavateras, marvel of Peru, verducas, tube
roses, which seem born of the white rose
and lily; and scarlet beans, which, though
we are apt to think little of them, because
they furnish us with a good vegetable,
are quick and beautiful growing, and in
a few weeks will hang a walk or trellis,
with an exuberant tapestry of scarlet and
green.</p>

<p>“The fruits begin to abound, and are
more noticed in proportion to the necessity
for them, occasioned by the summer
heat. The strawberries are in their
greatest quantity and perfection; and
currants, gooseberries and raspberries,
have a world of juice for us, prepared
as it were, in so many crowds of little
bottles, in which the sunshine has turned
the dew of April into wine. The strawberry
lurks about under a beautiful leaf.
Currants are also extremely beautiful.
A handsome bunch looks like pearls,
or rubies, and an imitation of it would
make a most graceful earring.</p>

<p>“It is now the season for bathing;
a refreshment too little taken in this
country, either in summer or winter.
We say in winter, because with very
little care in placing it in a cistern, and
having a leathern pipe for it, a bath may
be easily filled once or twice a week
with warm water; and it is a vulgar
error that the warm bath relaxes.”</p>

<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap">Military Chivalry.</span>—“I heard once,”
said Father Phil, “a pretty little bit of
an anecdote about the way the French
behaved to one of our Irish regiments
on a retreat in Spain. They were going
through a river—they were—and the
French, taking advantage of their helpless
condition, were peppering away at
them hard and fast, until some women
ran down, poor creatures, to the shore,
and the stream was so deep in the middle
that they could scarcely ford it; so
some dragoons, who were galloping as
fast as they could out of the fire, pulled
up on seeing the condition of the womankind,
and each horseman took up a woman
behind him, though it diminished
his own power of flying from the danger.
The moment the French saw this act of
manly courage, they ceased firing, and
gave a cheer for the dragoons; and as
long as the women were within gun-shot,
not a trigger was pulled in the French
line, but volleys of cheers instead of ball
cartridges, were sent after the brigade
till all the women were over.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Life of Martin Luther.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> famous man was born at Eisleben,
then in Saxony, but now within
the limits of Prussia. His father,
Hans, or John Luther, was a native
of Mora, near Eisenach; he was originally
a woodcutter, and in very humble
circumstances. His wife often carried
the wood to market on her back. On the
occasion of a fair at the latter place, the
parents both went thither, and on the
night of their arrival, November 10, 1483,
the mother gave birth to a son. This
occurred on the eve of St. Martin’s day,
and hence the infant was called Martin.
Six months after this event, the parents
went to live at Mansfeld, and ten miles
from Eisleben, where the father pursued
the business of a miner with great success.</p>

<p>Young Luther was brought up in the
strict habits and under the severe discipline
of the age. His father was accustomed
to inflict on him cruel chastisements,
and his mother, for a mere
trifle, whipped him till the blood came.
Such was the general system of family
government at that day. When sufficiently
advanced, Martin Luther was
sent to Eisenach, where he had access
to an institution which taught the learning
of the time. But he had no friends,
and was obliged to procure his own bread.
For this purpose, he used to go about the
streets, with some of his companions as
poor as himself, singing at the door of
such as would listen. He had a fine
talent for music, and though he often
chanted the favorite songs and ballads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of the day, he also sometimes sung his
own compositions. This he was accustomed
to call “bread music.”</p>

<p>In one of his excursions, he came to
the house of a respectable man, named
Conrad Cotta. Before it rose some lofty
trees. In the shadow of these, young
Martin threw himself down, and his
heart being burdened with sadness, he
poured forth his feelings in a strain of
plaintive melody. The wife of Conrad,
attracted by the melancholy tones, came
to the door, and invited the youth to enter.
She then placed before him the fare
her humble house afforded. The boy’s
gratitude, ardently expressed, touched
her heart, and she invited him to come
again. Thus an acquaintance began, and
Luther was, after a short time, invited
to take up his residence at the house,
which he did; and thus, relieved from
the evils of poverty, he was able to prosecute
his studies. Long after, when his
fame filled all Europe, these kind and
efficient friends had the pleasure to reflect
that the great Reformer was the
hungry ballad-singer, whom they had
comforted and cherished in the days of
poverty.</p>

<p>Having spent five years at Eisenach,
Luther was sent, in 1501, to the university
of Erfurth, then a respectable seminary,
but since suppressed. His father
wished him to study law, but he had
little inclination for this, and devoted
himself to general literature and music,
which latter he continued to cultivate
through life. At the university, he showed
the jovial, careless disposition which
generally marks the German student.
He was, however, much struck when
one day searching for an old book in the
library, to meet with a copy of the Bible.
He had before thought that all sacred
writings were contained in the portions
which were read in the churches. This
discovery doubtless gave occasion to
much reflection.</p>

<p>In 1505, an event occurred, which
changed the current of Luther’s thoughts,
and gave direction to his future life. He
was a lover of nature, and one day indulging
his taste in this respect, he was
rambling through the fields with a friend.
A storm was gathering over their heads,
but they continued the conversation,
which had relation to some serious subject.
In the mind of Luther, the pealing
thunder was the type of the future judgment.
He turned to speak to his companion,
when, at the very instant, the
latter was struck dead by a flash of
lightning. Luther stood a moment in
fear and awe; he then knelt by the side of
his companion, and lifting his eyes to
Heaven, he made a solemn vow to devote
his future life to the service of God.
Educated in the Catholic faith, this was
equivalent to a vow that he would enter
a monastery and become a monk, which
he did in 1505, in spite of his father’s
remonstrances.</p>

<p>It was in the Augustine convent of
Erfurth, that Luther had now taken his
vows. With the ardor and sincerity of
his character, he devoted himself to religious
contemplation; but he did not, in
the retirement of the cloister, find the
peace he sought and anticipated. He
was haunted by temptations, and distressed
by scruples and doubts. He discovered
what had not before been suggested
to his mind, that, in the absence of
substantial enemies found in the world,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
the mind may people the solitary cell
with demons, which have the power as
effectually to stab our peace.</p>

<p>In the convent Luther at last found a
friend, who understood his character and
ministered to his spiritual wants. This
was Staupnitz, the provincial of the order,
or ecclesiastical governor of the
Augustine convents in the district of
Erfurth. He was an intelligent, honest,
and kindhearted man, and by advice,
instruction, and encouragement, cleared
the mind and lightened the heart of the
distracted votary.</p>

<p>The talents of Luther were soon appreciated,
and in 1508, at the instance
of Staupnitz, he was appointed a professor
of philosophy in the university of
Wittenberg. He here delivered lectures,
which were well attended, and which
were marked by a freedom of thought
and manner unusual at that day. In
1510, he was sent to Italy, on business
connected with the order, which laid the
foundation of a great change in his views.</p>

<p>Luther was a sincere votary of the
Catholic Church. With the simplicity
of an honest mind, he supposed that he
should find religion in its utmost purity
at Rome, and that the Pope, the head of
the church, would be a fit representative
of the Holy Apostle of whom he claimed
to be the successor. How was he doomed
to be disappointed in these views!</p>

<p>On his arrival at the city of Milan, he
was received into one of the convents as
a guest. Here he found his brethren,
instead of devoting themselves to the
austerities of religion, as was the case at
Wittenberg, addicted to every species of
luxury. In the seclusion of their cloisters,
they sat down to sumptuous tables,
loaded with luscious viands, delicious
fruits and choice wines. Sheltered from
the observation of the world, they cast
aside the forms and ceremonies of their
order, and gave themselves up to license
and indulgence. Fasts were neglected—penances
despised. Luther looked on
with horror, and at last, unable to restrain
his emotions, broke forth in terms
of reprobation of these debaucheries.</p>

<p>The monks, being alarmed lest they
should be exposed, caused poison to be
administered to Luther;—the dose was
slight, and they intended to repeat it;
but finding himself unwell in the night,
he arose and set forward upon his journey.
He thus unconsciously baffled his
enemies, though his health suffered for
a long time from the effects of the poison
he had taken.</p>

<p>Pursuing his way chiefly on foot, Luther
at last arrived at Rome. When he
reached the city, his heart burning with
religious veneration, he knelt down, lifted
his hands to Heaven, and exclaimed
“I salute thee, Holy Rome, sanctified by
the blood of the martyrs!” With an
eagerness that nothing could repress, he
now ran from place to place, all seeming
in his pious imagination to be consecrated
ground.</p>

<p>The pope at that time was Julius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
He was a man little calculated to satisfy
the views of Luther. He had arisen
from an humble condition to the loftiest
pitch of earthly power. Nothing could
be more directly opposed to the meek
spirit of Christianity than his whole soul
and character. He was a subtle politician,
a bold and ambitious statesman,
an impetuous and determined warrior.
How was Luther shocked, when he expected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
to hear of the pious virtues of his
Holiness, to find him only spoken of for
his gigantic ambition; his worldly policy;
his achievements in the field, as commander
of his own forces; his magnificent
schemes of earthly aggrandizement,
alike respecting himself and the papal
see!</p>

<p>One of his schemes of ambition was to
erect a church at Rome, surpassing all
others in magnificence. Accordingly, in
1506, four years before Luther’s arrival,
the corner stone of St. Peter’s was laid.
In a few months, pushed on by the zeal
of the pontiff, the walls were towering
over the other churches of Rome; but
this precipitation caused the enormous
masses to crack, and thus, the progress
of the vast enterprise was retarded. It
was not till long after that this edifice
was finished. The expense was enormous,
and it will hereafter be seen that
this had a direct connection with the
reformation of which Luther was the
great instrument.</p>

<p>During his short stay at Rome, Luther
beheld the pope in a religious procession.
He was raised on a platform, and
carried on the shoulders of priests, who
deemed it a favor thus to bear the sacred
representative of God on earth. His
head was bowed upon his breast in token
of humility, but he was attired in the
most gorgeous robes. His crown glittering
with jewels, was borne on a cushion
by the highest dignitaries. Then followed
others with fans, of peacock and
ostrich plumes, which they waved around
the person of the pontiff, to guard it from
every unhallowed mote. Then came the
retinue of cardinals and bishops with
crosses and relics, and incense, and music,
and lighted tapers, and revered trophies,
with all the pomp and circumstance,
that human ingenuity, seeking to
capture the imagination, could invent.
The mighty pageant swept by, “and
this,” said Luther, “was all I saw of
religion in Rome.”</p>

<p>He stayed but a fortnight in that city.
He was disheartened and disgusted with
what he saw. Rome was filled with
vice of every horrid form, and every
degree of enormity. He found, too, that
the pope and his cardinals were mere
men of the world, that the priests were
generally voluptuaries, and many of them
open infidels. Admitted as he was to
intimacy with many of them, he found
that they often made a jest and mockery
of the most holy rites, and even while
performing the offices of the sacrament,
in a sort of by-play turned them into
ridicule, and sneered at the deluded
people who looked with reverence upon
these ceremonies. He hastened back
to Germany, his heart distressed, his
mind bewildered, his faith shaken. It
was this going to Rome, however, that
laid the foundation of his subsequent
career.</p>

<p>Having returned to Wittenberg, Luther
devoted himself to his professorship,
seeking peace of mind in a vigorous discharge
of its duties. Staupnitz, who saw
his great powers, urged him to become a
doctor of divinity. Luther consented,
and Frederick, Elector of Saxony, and
called the Wise, being proud of him, as
a native of his dominion, and an ornament
of the university, paid the expenses
of his inauguration.</p>

<p>Julius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> died February 13, 1513, and
the Cardinal Jean de Medicis, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
name of Leo <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr>, became the pope. In
1517, he authorized the sale of indulgences
in Germany, as Julius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> had
done in France, Poland, &amp;c. The avowed
object was to raise money to defray
the expenses of the Church of St. Peter’s
at Rome, and to sustain the christian
league against the Turks. Very little,
however, of the vast sums of money
obtained, was devoted to the objects for
which it was avowedly raised.</p>

<p>The practice of granting indulgences,
had existed for centuries before the time
of Luther. The Romish Church, assuming
to embody the power of Christ,
claimed the privilege of remitting the
penalty and averting the punishment,
here and hereafter, of any sin committed,
provided it was confessed and
repented of. A penance was often imposed,
as the condition of such remission
and forgiveness. This penance frequently
was commuted for a sum of money,
given to the church. Thus money, in
the light of penance, became one of the
means and instruments by which sin
was to be pardoned. From this position,
the next step, the sale of indulgences,
was obvious and easy. The popes and
priests wanted money, and holding the
consciences of men in their grasp, they
easily laid them under contribution.</p>

<p>Leo’s chief agent in the sale of indulgences
was a Dominican monk, by the
name of Tetzel. He was a man of high
rank and station in the church, and
possessed all the address, cunning and
effrontery necessary to success in such
a business. Clothed with the full power
of the pope, and encompassed by all
the insignia of the church, his manner
was lofty and his aspect imposing.
He was paid eighty florins, or forty
dollars, a month, beside all his expenses.
He was allowed a carriage and three
horses. His perquisites, however, far
exceeded his regular pay. His success
was so great, that at the town of Freyberg,
he sold indulgences to the amount of
two thousand florins, in two days.</p>

<p>To show the effrontery of the man,
thus employed by the pope, we may state
that he was guilty of the most abominable
profligacy, and though a priest, sworn
to celibacy, carried about with him two
of his own children! These things, however,
did not prevent the success of his
traffic. When he came to a place, he
went into the church, and set up a cross,
with the pope’s arms suspended upon it.
He then ascended the pulpit, and addressed
the multitude who gathered to
hear him.</p>

<p>He declared that indulgences “are the
most precious and sublime gifts of God;”
that “this cross has as much efficacy as
the cross of Christ.” “Draw near, and
I will give you letters, duly sealed, by
which even the sins you shall hereafter
devise and commit, shall all be forgiven
you.” “I would not exchange my privileges
for those of St. Peter in Heaven,
for I have saved more souls with my
indulgences, than he with his sermons.”
“There is no sin so great that the indulgence
cannot remit it”—“only pay
largely, and the greatest crime shall be
forgiven!” “Even repentance is not
indispensable.”</p>

<p>Having thus set forth the tempting
qualities of his merchandise, he would
appeal to the feelings of his auditors:
he would draw terrible pictures of the
torments of purgatory, to which they
were all exposed, and bright ones of the
bliss of the heaven they could so easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
purchase; he painted the torments of
those already in the fires of hell, and appealed
to friends around, to know if they
would not buy an indulgence for them—for
they could even reach such as had
already entered into judgment. “Yes,”
said he, “the very moment that the
money clinks against the bottom of the
chest, the soul escapes from purgatory,
and flies free to Heaven!”</p>

<p>Thus every art and device was adopted,
to cheat the people into the purchase
of these impious, corrupting and fraudulent
papers. At the present day, it would
be matter of course, that such practices
would be punished by confinement in
the state’s prison; but at that period,
under the high sanction of the church,
the fraud was not detected by the mass,
and multitudes readily availed themselves
of the opportunity to appease their
consciences for past crimes, and to fortify
themselves in impunity for future iniquity.
It is scarcely possible to conceive
of the state of darkness into which the
minds of men had sunk, at this period.
Was it not necessary, that reformation
should be wrought in that church, which
had brought mankind to this condition?</p>

<p>The people flocked in crowds to Tetzel
and his coadjutors. Men and women,
the young and the old, the poor, and
even beggars, came—and with money
too—for such was the eagerness to possess
the proffered blessings, that all
would in some way obtain the means.
Close by the cross, and in the church, the
seller had a counter, where he received
his money and delivered the indulgences.
Confession was administered to the purchaser,
but this was a mere form; it was
not insisted that penitence must be a condition
of pardon. Kings, queens, princes,
archbishops and bishops, were to pay
twenty-five ducats; abbots, counts, barons,
&amp;c., ten ducats. Thus the prices were
graduated to the condition of the purchaser;
and indeed, special bargains
were made suited to the ability of the
applicant, and the nature of the sins he
wished to expiate.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Although the mass of the people believed
in the efficacy of indulgences, and
the propriety of their sale, there were
many who condemned the whole traffic
as a cheat. Among these was a gentleman
of Saxony, who heard Tetzel at
Leipsic, and was much shocked at the
imposture. He went to the church, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
asked him if he was authorized to pardon
sins of intention—or such as he intended
to commit? Tetzel replied in the affirmative,
and after some chaffing, the gentleman
paid thirty crowns for an indulgence,
by which he was to be forgiven
for beating one against whom he had a
grudge.</p>

<p>Soon after this Tetzel set out from
Leipsic, and this Saxon gentleman, overtaking
him in the forests of Jutterbock,
gave him a severe drubbing, and carried
off the box in which he had his treasures.
Tetzel raised a great clamor for this act
of violence, and brought an action before
the judges of the district against the perpetrator.
The latter, however, pleaded
the indulgence, and was fully acquitted.</p>

<p>Luther, at this time, was professor of
Theology at Wittenberg, and he soon
had an opportunity of seeing the effects
of Tetzel’s operations. Upon some persons
under his spiritual charge, he enjoined
penance; but they refused to
submit to this, declaring that they had
been released from every penalty by
Tetzel. Luther having denied them
absolution, because they would not submit
to the prescribed penance, some of
them went to Tetzel, and made complaints
of Luther. Upon this, the former
threatened with punishment, here and
hereafter, all those who should deny the
efficiency of his indulgences.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Two Red Cents.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">grocer</span> in Clinton county sold a
drunkard a pint of new rum <em>according
to law</em>, and made <em>two red cents
clear profit</em>. The drunkard shot his
son-in-law while intoxicated; and his
apprehension, confinement in jail, execution,
&amp;c. cost the county more than
<em>one thousand dollars</em>—which temperate
men had to earn by the sweat of their
brows! What say tax-payers? Are you
willing to pay a thousand dollars to enable
the grog-seller to make <em>two red
cents</em>?</p>

<p>But this case is comparatively nothing
when contrasted with a recent transaction
about the 1st of July, 1843. An
Indian, one of those half-civilized, rum-loving
creatures who abound in the West,
stepped out of Cataraugus county into
the State of Pennsylvania, where, it
seems, men are sold indulgences to sin,
as well as in the Empire State; and then
filled his pocket-bottle with real “Red-eye,”
and the seller of the poison made
<em>two red cents</em> clear profit again. While
under its maddening influence, he went
into a farmer’s house near by with whom
he was totally unacquainted, and murdered
a mother and five children;—all
that comprised the little family, except
the husband and father, who was from
home. When he returned to his little
interesting family what a sight met his
eyes!—enough, it would seem, to curdle
his blood, and change the man to stone.
There lay the mother and her five little
ones—from ten years of age down to infancy,
stretched upon the floor—swimming
in blood, <em>and all dead</em>! Oh! what
desolation was there!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Charlotte Corday.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> are few incidents of the French
Revolution more intensely interesting
than those which relate to Charlotte
Corday. Paris was the scene
of the most violent commotions that have
ever been witnessed in civilized society.
All France was agitated with the strife
of parties that wrestled with each other
in the capital. The hearts of men seemed
to be filled with frenzy. The common
bonds of society were rent asunder;
new and strange ideas took possession
of the minds of the people. In the midst
of this excitement, and wrought up by
the fever of the time, to a design beyond
her sex, Charlotte Corday appeared upon
the theatre of action, and arrested even
the attention of the maddened populace
of Paris, by her heroic self-devotion.</p>

<p>The triumph of the Jacobins over the
rival Girondists in May, 1793, rendered
their power uncontrollable. Marat was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
treated with more honor and respect than
any individual since the revolution, and
exerted a sway in the Convention and the
clubs more absolute than was ever before
known in bodies styled deliberative. In
fact, they submitted to all his whims and
caprices, and seemed to derive to themselves
honor from the submission. His
extravagances were more bearable from
the obvious certainty that the wretch was
hastening to the grave, and that nothing
could save him. His constitution was
never good, and at this time, he was
preyed upon by a leprous complaint;
which adding its ravages to his natural
deformity and habitual want of personal
cleanliness, rendered him a most disgusting
object. But this man of blood
was not destined to end his days by
disease.</p>

<p>Of the Girondists, some were arrested
and executed, others succeeded in escaping,
and were outlawed. Of this latter
class, a number, among them Barbaroux,
he whose beauty of person and energy
of mind could move the heart of the philosophic
Madame Roland, had taken
refuge at Caen. They held daily meetings
at the town-hall, and thither frequently
came Charlotte Corday, a young
lady of stately figure, with an open and
intelligent countenance, and about twenty-five
years of age. Her deportment
was modest; she was of studious and
meditative habits, and was a republican
before the revolution. In her visits to
the town-hall, she was always attended
by a servant, and her inquiry was for
Barbaroux, with whom she had been long
acquainted, and with whom she pretended
to have business. She now heard
much of the atrocities of the Terrorists;
of the ferocity of Marat, who held in his
hands the destiny of her country, and
what was as much to her, the fate of
Barbaroux. Patriotism and love both
prompted her to the commission of an
act, by which, at the sacrifice of her own
life, she should be the savior both of her
country and her friend.</p>

<p>A nun of Caen was desirous to obtain
some family papers which were in the
office of the Minister of the Interior at
Paris. Charlotte offered to proceed thither
to procure them, and was furnished by
Barbaroux, with a letter of introduction
to his friend Dupenet, who would aid her
in procuring them.</p>

<p>On the 9th of July we find her seated
in the diligence, and the details of her
journey are thus given in a letter to
Barbaroux.</p>

<p>“You requested an account of my
journey, and I will not excuse you from
the slightest anecdotes. I travelled with
good mountaineers, whom I suffered to
talk as much as they pleased, and their
discourse, which was as absurd as their
persons were disagreeable, contributed
not a little to lull me to sleep. I was
not perfectly awake till I arrived at Paris.
One of my fellow travellers, who is, undoubtedly
an admirer of sleepy women,
took me for the daughter of one of his
old friends, supposed me possessed of a
fortune which I have not, gave me a
name which I never heard, and, in conclusion,
offered me his hand and fortune.
When I was tired of his conversation,
I said, ‘We are admirable comedians,
what a pity that, with such talents, we
have no spectators; I will go and fetch
our fellow-travellers, that they may have
their share of the amusement.’ I left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
him in a very ill humor; all night he
sung plaintive songs, excellent procreatives
of sleep. At length I parted with
him at Paris, refusing to give him my
address, or that of my father, of whom he
wished to ask me in marriage.”</p>

<p>She delivered her letter to Dupenet,
and the ostensible object of her journey
was accomplished. But she said nothing
of returning. She visited the Convention.
Marat was not there, he was confined
to his house by sickness. She
proceeded thither, but was refused admittance.</p>

<p>She returned to her inn, and despatched
a note, telling him that she was
from Caen, the seat of rebellion; that she
desired earnestly to see him, and would
put it in his power to do France a great
service. She received no answer. She
wrote another note still more pressing,
and carried it herself to the door. He
was just leaving his bath, but her business
was urgent, and she was admitted
to his presence. “I am from Caen,” said
she, “and wished to speak with you.”
“Be seated, my child. What are the
traitors doing at Caen? What deputies
are at Caen?” He took out his tablets,
and wrote down the names as Charlotte
gave them,—“Louvet, Petion, Barbaroux;
I will have them all guillotined at
Paris within a fortnight.” “Then you
shall precede them,” exclaimed Charlotte,
and plunged a dagger through his
heart.</p>

<p>She was at once seized and committed
to prison. We will again quote from
her letter to Barbaroux. “I expected to
have been instantly put to death, but
some men, truly courageous, preserved
me from the excusable rage of those I
had rendered unhappy. As I really
preserved my presence of mind, I felt
hurt at the exclamations of some women,
but those who save their country think
nothing of the cost. May peace be established
as soon as I wish it! For these
two days I have enjoyed a delicious state
of mental repose. The happiness of my
country constitutes mine; there is no
act of self-devotion which does not overpay
in pleasure, the pain of resolving
to adopt it. I never hated but one single
being, and I have demonstrated how
violent that hatred was. But there are
thousands whom I love with more
warmth than I hated him. A lively imagination
and a feeling heart promise but
a stormy life; I beg those who may regret
my fate to think of this, and they
will rejoice at seeing me enjoy repose
in the Elysian fields with Brutus and a
few of the ancients. As for the moderns,
there are few real patriots, who know
how to die for their country; they are
almost all selfish. What a people to
form a republic! I am exceedingly well
accommodated in my prison; the jailors
are the best kind of people in the world;
to keep away <i lang="fr">ennui</i> they have placed
soldiers in my room. I have no objection
to make to this by day, but by night
it is not so pleasant. I have complained
of the indecency, but no one has thought
fit to attend to my remonstrance....
My trial comes on to-morrow at eight;
probably at noon, according to the Roman
phrase, <em>I shall have lived</em>. I cannot
say how I shall encounter my last moments;
I have no need to affect insensibility,
for I never yet knew the fear of
death, and never loved life but in proportion
to its possible utility.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>On the 17th of July she was put on
trial, and avowed the fact and all the
circumstances, alleging, as justification,
that she considered Marat a criminal
already convicted by public opinion, and
that she had a right to put him to death.
She added, that she did not expect to
have been brought to trial, but to have
been delivered up to the rage of the
populace, torn to pieces, and that her
head, borne on a pike before the corpse
of Marat, would have served as a rallying
point to Frenchmen, if any still existed
worthy of the name.</p>

<p>She was led from the place of trial to
that of execution. On the way she displayed
a firmness and tranquillity which
even awed into silence the <i lang="fr">poissardes</i>,
those furies of the guillotine, who in
general pursued the victim to death with
execrations and reproaches. She submitted
to her fate with the same composure
that had marked all her previous
conduct.</p>

<p>The circumstances which attended this
extraordinary action, the privacy with
which it was concerted, the resolution
with which it was executed, the openness
of confession, the contempt of punishment,
and, above all, the execrable character
of the monster who was the subject
of it, have taken off so much of the horror
generally felt at an act of assassination,
that the name of Charlotte Corday is
generally pronounced with respect and
a great degree of admiration.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Conjugal Affection.</h3>

<p class="center">CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I.</abbr><br>
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">ne</span> of the most remarkable instances
of conjugal affection is furnished by
the story of Victoria Colonna, which
I will relate.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Colonna was accused
by one of the emissaries of the Inquisition,
of heresy and treason; and at the
instigation of his uncle, Montalbert, who
wished to ruin him, through private hatred,
Colonna was seized and thrown
into a dungeon, his chateau ransacked,
and his wife and child were dispossessed
of their inheritance.</p>

<p>Colonna had been conveyed to the
castle of St. Angelo, and this was all
that could be heard respecting him.
Whether he had been tried and convicted,
could not be learned. He was,
in short, as dead to the world and all his
family and connections, as if he had suffered
the usual lot of mortality; and as
such occurrences were by no means
uncommon in the Italian states during
the reign of papal tyranny, Colonna was
speedily forgotten by all except his faithful
wife, Victoria.</p>

<p>Although interdicted by the cruel laws
of the Inquisition, and threatened with
the denunciations of the spiritual pater,
Victoria traversed nightly the walls of
the great citadel; sometimes wading up
to her knees in the Tiber, when making
the circuit of the towers and bastions,
listening in the midnight hour for the
slightest sigh, or footfall, that might reveal
to her the cell in which her beloved
husband was immured. But for several
months, all her efforts to discover it were
unavailing. Yet, nothing daunted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
want of success, and feeling no love of
life but in her husband’s company, the
faithful woman still continued in the
fond and <a id="chg1"></a>anxious hope that Heaven would,
at its fitting time, listen to her prayers,
and that she should again be blessed
with a sight of him so dear to her, or
that she should at least become acquainted
with his fate.</p>

<p>Nor were her hopes in the end disappointed;
for, early one morning, as she
was finishing her accustomed nightly
wanderings round the black and desolate
pile, her attention was aroused,
about the time of dawn, by the clattering
of a chip of a tile from the battlements,
which fell close to her feet. She immediately
looked for the falling object; her
quick hopes immediately surmising it to
be some signal from the one she sought.
Nor was she disappointed; the tile had
been scratched upon by a nail, and on it
were inscribed the names of Albert and
Victoria. In a moment of rapture, she
pressed the tablet to her heart, fell on her
knees, and offered her thanks to Heaven.
She then turned her eyes toward the
lofty towers, and again small fragments
of stone were made to descend from a
small grating about half way towards the
top. “Here then,” she ejaculated, “here
is the cell of my beloved husband.” She
was confirmed in her thoughts, by perceiving
the delicate hand of Albert
thrust through the narrow aperture of
the bars; and the sight of it so affected
her that she fell down in a swoon, overcome
with hope and love and joy.</p>

<p>When she recovered, she made the
best of her way to her dwelling in the
city, and immediately began to concert
measures for her husband’s escape. But
when she considered the height and
thickness of the walls, the vigilance of
the guards, the jealousy of the priesthood,
the suspicions of her neighbors,
and the espionage of the minions of the
Inquisition, she almost despaired. Yet,
as she fervently trusted in Heaven for
aid, she determined to use every effort
to accomplish her object, and sat down
at once to consider the best means of
doing so.</p>

<p>The first difficulty that presented itself
was that of establishing communication
between herself and the prisoner.
This the quickness of her mind immediately
overcame; or at least fancied it
could. She thought that by raising a
small paper kite by the side of the tower,
its string might be easily made to pass
over the grated aperture of the dungeon.
But how was the prisoner to be made
acquainted with the operation, which
must necessarily be made in darkness,
and at a time of night, when people are
usually in a deep slumber?</p>

<p>Waving all difficulties, however, she
determined to make the attempt on the
following night. As soon as it was
night, she put on the disguise of one of
those miserable wretches who search
and prowl about on the muddy banks of
the river to pick up the refuse of the city.
The wind was fortunately fresh, as it
was late in the month of October. She
had not forgotten to provide herself with
the fragile instrument upon which her
hopes were built. It was a small paper
kite, formed of oil paper, stretched upon
two cross pieces of very fine whalebone;
and for a string, she employed the
strongest silk she could procure. The
kite was with some difficulty at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
raised, and fluttered up at the sides of
the tower. With great patience and
ingenuity, the indefatigable wife brought
it close against the grating from which
the tile had been thrown. The wind
caused it to beat and flutter against the
bars. It aroused the prisoner. He put
his hand forth, and succeeded in obtaining
the kite.</p>

<p>Although all was dark, yet the expectant
prisoner had light enough in his own
thoughts to see that this was the part of
some plan for his deliverance; and he
could attribute it to no one but to her
whom he knew to be attached to him in
life or death. Finding, therefore, the
string still held below, he gave it several
pulls. This was felt by Victoria, who,
overjoyed beyond measure, fastened a
note to its extremity, explaining the
plan for his escape, and promising on
the next night, by the same means, to
make another communication; and having
so far succeeded, she withdrew.</p>

<p>I need not attempt to describe the
feverish anxiety of the following day,
both to the prisoner and his wife. To
Victoria, as well as to Albert, it was an
age in length. At length, however, the
night did arrive, and at the accustomed
hour, Victoria again raised her little kite,
and by this means established a communication
as before; and through its instrumentality,
she supplied the prisoner
with paper and pencil to communicate
his wishes and his desires.</p>

<p>On the next night, Albert prepared an
account of what had befallen him since
the period of his arrest; that he had
been three times examined before the
Inquisition, and exhorted to confess;
that he expected daily again to be summoned;
and that he had been threatened
to be put to the torture. He also begged
her to make herself well acquainted with
the plan of the prison, its avenues, passages,
and character of its keepers; and
if possible, to obtain an admission within
the walls.</p>

“Two lovers were loitering along the
margin of a lake on a fine summer’s
evening, when the maiden discovered
some flowers growing in the water close
to the bank of an island at some distance
from the shore. She expressed a desire
to possess them, when her knight, in the
true spirit of chivalry, plunged into the
water, and, swimming to the spot, cropped
the wished-for plant; but his strength
was unable to fulfil the object of his
achievement; and feeling that he could
not regain the shore, although very near
it, he threw the flowers on the bank, and

 alt="Frederick II.">

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<h3 class="h3head">Frederick <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> king of Prussia, who acquired the
title of <em>the great</em>, was born on the
24th of January, 1712. He was
reared in the school of adversity;
his father, Frederick William, being a
brutal tyrant, even in his own family.
To escape from this domestic tyranny,
which was almost insupportable, he
planned a clandestine flight from Prussia,
with a confidant by the name of De
Katt. His father discovered this before
it could be carried into effect. The consequence
was, that Frederick was arrested
along with his friend, and both
were instantly tried before an obedient
court-martial, which condemned them to
death. This sentence would have been
carried into effect against the Prince, but
for the interposition of Charles the VIth,
of Austria, to whose earnest entreaties
Frederick William at length yielded,
with the prophetic remark that “Austria
would one day discover what a serpent
she had nourished in her bosom.”</p>

<p>The prince, however, suffered a long
and severe imprisonment, in the fort of
Custrin, where, as if to aggravate his
punishment, the unfortunate De Katt was
beheaded on a scaffold, raised before his
apartment, to the level of the window,
from which he was compelled to witness
this cruel and afflicting spectacle. His
subsequent treatment in prison was as
harsh and severe as that of the meanest
felon, and a considerable time elapsed
before he found the means of softening
its rigor.</p>

<p>This was at length managed through
the instrumentality of a Baron Wrech,
whose family lived in the neighborhood,
and who, at considerable risk as well as
expense, furnished him with books, music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and other comforts. By degrees he
so gained upon his gaoler, that he was
permitted, under cover of the night, to
visit at the Baron’s residence; and as
the young Wrechs were sprightly and
accomplished, as well as anxious to serve
him, they got up little concerts for his
amusement. In this way, for upwards
of a year, his imprisonment was greatly
ameliorated.</p>

<p>The old king at last relented, and
Frederick obtained his liberty; but it
was only on the special condition that
he married Elizabeth Christina, a princess
of the house of Brunswick. This
forced marriage proved utterly abortive
of the object intended by the tyrannical
old match-maker, for Frederick
never lived with the princess, although,
through life, he treated her with the
greatest respect. She was a woman of
meritorious conduct, but quite destitute
of personal attractions.</p>

<p>Frederick’s marriage took place in
1732, and from that time till the death
of his father in 1740, he resided at
Rheinsberg, a village some leagues from
Berlin. During this interval of eight
years, he devoted himself chiefly to literary
pursuits, and wrote his <cite>Anti-Machiavel</cite>,
and <cite>Reflections on the Character of
Charles <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr></cite> The social circle with
which he was connected at this time,
consisted mostly of learned and ingenious
Frenchmen, and probably that circumstance
contributed to imbue him
with the strong predilection which he
ever afterwards displayed in favor of
everything French.</p>

<p>His accession to the throne in 1740,
brought at once into action the whole
energies of his character. He himself
entered personally upon all the duties,
usually committed by kings to their
ministers; and in order to accomplish
the multiplicity of business which thus
devolved upon him, he laid down strict
rules for the appropriation of his time, to
which he ever afterwards scrupulously
adhered. He rose regularly at four in
the morning, occupying but a few minutes
with his dress, of which, however,
he was careless even to slovenliness;
and this practice he continued till a late
period of his life.</p>

<p>The details of a peaceful administration
were, however, found quite inadequate
to the activity of his mind. Accordingly,
in the first year of his reign,
he resolved on war; but, unfortunately
for his character, it was a war of aggression—a
war, too, against a female, and
the heir of the very house which had
saved him from the scaffold. He resolved
to wrest Silesia from Maria
Theresa, of Austria, and in less than
two years he accomplished this object,
the province being ceded to him by the
treaty of Breslaw, in 1742. It has ever
since continued to form a part of the
Prussian dominions.</p>

<p>The acquisition of Silesia, and the
grasping policy of Frederick seem to
have excited the jealousy of other European
powers, as well as the enmity of
Austria; for a new war broke out in
1742, in which, after a good deal of
bloodshed, Prussia was again victorious,
and had the possession of Silesia confirmed
to her by a new treaty.</p>

<p>In the succeeding ten years, Frederick
sedulously cultivated the arts of
peace, and by adhering strictly to the
systematic apportionment of his time, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
was enabled to exercise a personal superintendence
over every department of
government, without abridging either
his pleasures or amusements, and without
the slightest abandonment of his literary
pursuits. He carried on an extensive
correspondence with Voltaire, and
several of the most distinguished literati
of Europe. He wrote the <cite>History of his
own Times</cite>, and <cite>Memoirs of the House
of Brandenburg</cite>; and he re-established
the Academy of Sciences of Berlin. It
was in the interval of peace, too, that he
invited Voltaire, and other literary characters
to reside at his capital. The visit
of that extraordinary man, and its result,
are well known. The quarrel between
him and Frederick, and the terms on
which they parted, were little creditable
to either; and, besides, they very clearly
proved to the world, that in the business
of life, philosophers are not superior to
ordinary men.</p>

<p>The most important portion, however,
of all Frederick’s labors during these ten
years of peace, was his civil administration.
It comprehended various useful
reforms, and the introduction of numerous
improvements, for the benefit of the
people. He was zealous in the cause
of education, and in the establishment
of schools and professorships. He also
caused the laws to be revised and a new
code to be prepared, which, after much
labor, was effected, and it still goes under
his name. This code abolished torture,
and recognized universal toleration
in religion. Perhaps the general character
of the jurisprudence he established,
may be best gathered from his celebrated
instruction to the judges:—“If a
suit arise between me and one of my
subjects, and the case is a doubtful one,
always decide against me.”</p>

<p>In the midst of all his improvements,
Frederick was again roused to war. He
had been advised that Austria, Russia,
and Saxony had entered into a treaty
for the conquest and partition of his territories.
He demanded an explanation
from the court of Vienna, which, being
unsatisfactory, he immediately struck
the first blow by marching an army into
Saxony, and taking possession of it almost
unopposed. Thus commenced the
celebrated “seven years’ war,” the result
of which, after numerous battles,
and an incredible waste of human life
and treasure, was a treaty which again
confirmed Prussia in the possession of
Silesia, and established the reputation
of Frederick as the greatest military
genius of the age.</p>

<p>The next ten years were spent in
efforts to repair the devastation and misery
which Prussia had suffered by the
war. Among other ameliorations, may
be mentioned his emancipation of the
peasantry, from hereditary servitude,
which he began by giving up his own
signorial rights over the serfs on the
crown domains. A good deal of his
time was also devoted to literary pursuits,
as it was during this period that
he wrote his “<cite>History of the Seven
Years’ War</cite>.”</p>

<p>In 1772 he became a party to the partition
of Poland, and shared largely in
the spoil, as well as in the disgrace of
that infamous political robbery. In
1778, he was again in hostility with
Austria, respecting the succession to
Bavaria, which that power, at the death
of the Elector, without issue, proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
on some antiquated, feudal grounds, to
re-annex to her own dominions. This
war was of short duration, Frederick being
successful in settling the question by
treaty. In 1785, he had another dispute
with Austria, in which he appeared as
the defender of the Germanic Confederation,
and the rights of its several princes.
Here he was also successful, the emperor
Joseph yielding the question at issue,
without having recourse to arms.</p>

<p>Frederick was now getting old, and
his constitution had begun to decay. He
also suffered occasionally from gout, the
necessary consequence of rich diet and
high-seasoned cookery, to which he was
all his life exceedingly partial. He had,
moreover, a voracious appetite, and he
constantly indulged it to repletion. This
brought on a complication of disorders,
under which he suffered severely, though
he never once uttered a complaint, but
continued his public services with as
much zeal and anxiety, as when in perfect
health. He continued to do so up
to August, 1786, when a confirmed dropsy
having supervened, he fell into a
lethargy on the 16th of that month, and
expired during the night.</p>

<p>An impartial reviewer of the reign of
Frederick, will discard all that is attractive
or dazzling in his character, either
from his talents as an accomplished warrior,
or his wit as a man of letters. He
will consider him simply as a ruler of a
nation, and a member of the great European
community. In that view it is impossible
to deny that his administration
of affairs was singularly marked by
promptitude and energy. Wherever active
exertions were required, or could
ensure success, he generally prevailed;
and to use the words of an elegant
writer, “as he was in all things a master
of those inferior abilities which are
denominated address, it is not wonderful
that he was uniformly fortunate in the
cabinets of his neighbors.” His reign,
however, with all its glory, and all its
success, both in diplomacy and war, was
a memorable proof that the happiness of
the people is of little consequence, even
to an enlightened despot, when balanced
either against his cupidity or his ambition.
It was these qualities alone that
embroiled Frederick with his neighbors;
and we have only to turn to his own
works for a melancholy confession of the
disastrous consequences which were thus
entailed upon his subjects.</p>

<p>“The state of Prussia,” says he, in
his history of his own times, “can only
be compared to that of a man riddled
with wounds, weakened by the loss of
blood, and ready to sink under the
weight of his misfortunes. The nobility
were exhausted, the commons ruined,
numerous villages were burnt, and many
towns were nearly depopulated. Civil
order was lost in a total anarchy; in
fact, the desolation was universal.” In
this candid exposure of the consequences
of his own policy, Frederick has given
the true character of his reign. Such
were the results of a successful career
of conquest; one which is often regarded
as the most brilliant in the annals of
mankind—one which conferred the title
of “the great,” on the chief actor; and
one which has been the almost unbounded
theme of eulogy. He increased his
kingdom by twenty thousand square
miles; left seventy millions of Prussian
dollars in the treasury, and an army of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
two hundred thousand men; yet, while
the government was thus enriched and
strengthened, we see by the monarch’s
own confession, how the people had suffered.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence that Frederick
was a man of art and learning;
and we know that he possessed the most
unbounded influence over his soldiery.
Before the battle of Rostorth, which led
to the most celebrated of all the king of
Prussia’s victories, Frederick addressed
his little army, not amounting to more
than twenty-five thousand men, in nearly
the following words: “My brave soldiers—the
hour is coming, in which all
that is, and all that ought to be, dear to
us, depends upon the swords that are
now drawn for the battle. Time permits
me to say but little, nor is there occasion
to say much. You know that
there is no labor, no hunger, no cold, no
watching, no danger, that I have not
shared with you, hitherto; and you now
see me ready to lay down my life with
you and for you. All I ask is the same
pledge of fidelity and affection that I
give. Acquit yourselves like men, and
put your confidence in God.”</p>

<p>The effect of this speech was indescribable.
The soldiers answered it by
a universal shout, and their looks and
demeanor became animated to a sort of
heroic frenzy. Frederick led on his
troops in person, exposed to the hottest
of the fire. The enemy for a few moments
made a gallant resistance; but,
overwhelmed by the headlong intrepidity
of the Prussians, they at length gave
way in every part, and fled in the utmost
disorder. Night alone saved from
destruction the scattered remains of an
army, which, in the morning, was double
the number of its conquerors.</p>

<p>There are some anecdotes which exhibit
the conqueror in a still more pleasing
light. He was fond of children, and
the young princes, his nephews, had always
access to him. One day, while he
was writing in his cabinet where the
eldest of them was playing with a ball,
it happened to fall on the table; the king
threw it on the floor, and wrote on;
presently after, the ball again fell on the
table; he threw it away once more, and
cast a serious look on the child, who
promised to be more careful, and continued
his play. At last, the ball unfortunately
fell on the very paper on which
the king was writing, who, being a little
out of humor, put the ball in his pocket.
The little prince humbly begged pardon,
and entreated to have his ball again,
which was refused. He continued some
time praying for it in a very piteous
manner, but all in vain. At last, grown
tired of asking, he placed himself before
his majesty, put his little hand to his
side, and said, with a menacing look and
tone, “Do you choose, sire, to restore
the ball, or not?” The king smiled,
took the ball from his pocket, and gave
it to the prince, with these words: “Thou
art a brave fellow; Silesia will never be
retaken while thou art alive.”</p>

<p>During his last illness, he endured
many restless nights, which he endeavored
to soothe by conversing with the
servant who chanced to sit up with him.
On one of these occasions, he inquired
of an honest young Pomeranian from
whence he came? “From a little village
in Pomerania.” “Are your parents
living?” “An aged mother.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
“How does she maintain herself?” “By
spinning.” “How much does she gain
daily by it?” “Sixpence.” “But she
cannot live well on that.” “In Pomerania,
it is cheap living.” “Did you
never send her anything?” “O, yes;
I have sent her at different times a few
dollars.” “That was bravely done; you
are a good boy. You have a deal of
trouble with me. Have patience. I
shall endeavor to lay something by for
you, if you behave well.” The monarch
kept his word; for, a few nights
after, the Pomeranian being again in attendance,
received several pieces of
gold, and heard, to his great joy and
surprise, that one hundred <a id="chg2"></a>six dollars
had been settled on his mother during
her life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> rushing sound that filled my ears,
as I fainted and fell to the earth before
the terrific image of the monster
that threatened me with instant
death, was occasioned by the discharge
of a musket. How often does it happen
that Providence interposes to save us,
when there appears to be no help at
hand, and hope itself has departed. A
negro hunter happened to be passing at
the precise moment that the serpent was
about to rush upon me, and crush me in
its folds. I was concealed from his view
by the bushes that intervened; but he
saw the threatening attitude of the reptile,
and knew that it was about to strike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
upon some object near at hand. The
huntsman was on horseback, but the serpent
was so intent upon its prey, that it
allowed the man to approach within a
few yards. He then levelled his gun,
and the discharge nearly severed its
head from the body. The convulsions
of the dying monster lashed the earth,
and tore the adjacent herbage, while the
space around was covered with blood.
These struggles gradually subsided; the
form was stretched out at length upon
the ground in a waving line, and, except
a tremulous motion along the back, and
a faint vibration of the tail, the creature
ceased to move.</p>

<p>Of this scene, I was, however, wholly
unconscious. The negro, in looking about
for the object of the serpent’s meditated
blow, soon discovered me. He raised
my head from the earth, and, after a few
moments, I slowly recovered my senses.
When my eyes first fell upon the face
of the negro, his head covered with an
immense palm-leaf hat, a strange fancy
crossed my mind. I conceived myself
to be in the coils of the serpent, and the
countenance of the negro seemed to be
the image of my destroyer. But this illusion
quickly passed away, and I speedily
realized my deliverance. A sense of
unspeakable joy thrilled through my
heart, and I burst into a flood of tears.
I was utterly unable to speak, but I
clasped the hands of the negro, who
was kneeling by me, and showed in his
countenance the utmost sympathy and
kindness. Never have I felt toward
any human being a more grateful emotion,
than toward my kind-hearted preserver
at that moment.</p>

<p>I was soon able to get upon my feet,
but when I saw the outstretched form
of the serpent, and beheld the traces of
blood, and the earth torn by its dying
agony, a faintness again came over me,
and I should have fallen to the ground,
but for the support afforded by my protector.
He now spoke to me, but in a
language which I did not understand.
He seemed to comprehend my situation,
however, and, placing me upon the saddle
of his horse, he mounted behind me.
After winding through the shrubbery for
a short distance, we came to a pathway
along which we proceeded for the space of
an hour, during which the negro paid the
utmost attention to my weakness. He held
me upon the saddle, kept the somewhat
impatient steed in a walk, and did all in his
power to render my situation comfortable.</p>

<p>I now observed that we were emerging
from the forest, and that cultivated fields
were opening before us. I noticed plantations
upon the hill sides, and, at a little
distance, I perceived scattered dwellings.
These, however, were of a very humble
cast, the sides seeming to consist of stakes
woven together with palm leaves, and the
roofs to be made either of palm leaves
or straw. As we passed along, I noticed
a number of negroes engaged in various
occupations; but I discovered no white
people. The population increased as we
proceeded, and when at last we entered
a long, irregular street, the inhabitants
seemed to swarm like a bee-hive. Never
have I seen such a strange spectacle.
The town consisted of huts, such as I
have described, and the people were all
black. I had no difficulty in coming to
the conclusion that this was Maroontown—the
negro settlement, through which I
had expected to pass on my journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
As we proceeded through the street
of the town, we soon attracted attention,
and I became the special object of curiosity.
There were great numbers of
children, and being entirely naked, they
looked like so many little monkeys.
Many of them were lying down at their
ease; others were skipping and frisking
about like squirrels. Many of these began
to follow us, and when once a train
had formed behind us, the plot seemed
to thicken, and we were soon surrounded
by a throng of all sizes and sexes.
These flowed onward, leaping, shouting,
babbling, laughing and dancing, and performing
all sorts of antics.</p>

<p>At length we reached a hovel of somewhat
better appearance than the rest.
Here my guide dismounted, and, clearing
a space among the babbling crowd,
partly by threats, and partly by blows,
he took me from the horse, and carried
me into the dwelling. Placing me upon
a bed of straw, he drove out the children
that had rushed into the room, and fastened
the entrance. He then spoke to
his wife and daughter, no doubt giving
an account of the manner in which he
had discovered me. I became the immediate
object of the care and kindness
of the two women. They provided for
me some rice broth, of which I ate a little,
and, overpowered with fatigue, I fell
asleep. My slumbers, however, were
disturbed, and my mind was agitated
with terrific dreams. Worn out with
suffering of mind and body, my constitution
gave way, and I fell into a raging
fever.</p>

<p>During the period of my disease, I
had little consciousness, and I have but
faint remembrances of what passed. In
the lucid intervals which visited me, I
could always perceive some one of the
kind family watching at my bedside,
ready and prompt to attend to all my
wants and wishes. For the space of
three weeks, I remained in a critical
condition, apparently hovering upon the
narrow line between life and death.
Owing, however, to the prescriptions of
a black physician, who attended upon
me with great care, and the affectionate
nursing of my friends, aided by my elastic
constitution, the disease was at last
conquered, and I began to revive from
my prostrate condition. I was, indeed,
wasted to a shadow, and when the fever
left me, I could not lift my arm from the
bed, nor turn my head upon the pillow.
During this period of excessive weakness,
I was as tenderly treated, as if I
had been an infant, and the heir of the
house. Somebody was always at my
bedside to wet my parched lips with
lemonade, to bathe my forehead, or aid
me to change my position. The rough,
burly master of the hovel, when called
upon to lift me from my bed, seemed to
have a new sense of gentleness infused
into his clumsy hands and arms.</p>

<p>Under these kindly auspices, when
once my disease had left me, I gradually
acquired strength, and, in the space of a
fortnight was able to totter to the door.
I was led out by the two women, and, as
I gazed around upon the uncouth scene,
the ragged, irregular tenements, and the
half-naked inhabitants, it still seemed as
though I was breathing the air, and
gazing on the landscapes of a sort of
paradise. Such was the cheering influence
of that sense of returning health,
which flowed through my youthful veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>I now began to make some acquaintances
among the people; their language
was Dutch, with a mixture of negro
and Indian gibberish. Of this, I understood
nothing, except the names of a few
familiar objects, which I gradually learned.
At length, however, I met with a
woman, who had been a servant in an
English family, and could converse in
the English tongue. From her I learned
the history of this curious settlement. It
seems to have sprung up from the slaves
that escaped from their masters at Paramaribo,
and the plantations along the
Surinam. These were hunted by the
white people, and shot down like wild
animals, or, if captured, were subjected
to the most cruel punishments, and the
rigors of slavery were rendered still
more severe. The number of these fugitives
constantly increased. For a
time, indeed, they wandered in the forests,
often alone, and reduced to a state
of wildness, like the native animals of
the woods.</p>

<p>But they soon associated together,
and, by their union and numbers, became
formidable to their oppressors.
They retired to a considerable distance
from the Dutch settlements, and, occupying
a fertile tract of country, erected
such slight habitations as their means
afforded, and the climate required.
They began to till the soil, and bountiful
nature returned an abundant harvest for
their efforts. They increased rapidly,
and in process of years they established
a government suited to their condition.
By degrees the hostility between them
and the Dutch settlement subsided, and
amicable intercourse commenced, and at
the time I was there, a considerable traffic
was carried on between the inhabitants
of Maroontown and those of Paramaribo.
The settlement continues to
the present time to consist entirely of a
negro population, living in the heart of
Guiana, almost without the mixture of
foreign blood. Their manners are rather
those of Africa than America. We shall
have something more to say of this
strange place in another chapter.</p>

<p class="center">A FABLE.</p>

<p>Two musquitoes met upon a cabbage-leaf
one fine summer’s morning,
glutted with the spoils of the preceding
evening. Flushed with success,
and anxious for battle, they began
to eye each other with no very gentle
looks. Still they had no pretence upon
which to begin shedding each other’s
blood, till one of them ran out his sting,
and began to whet it and put it in order
for the first emergency. “Do you run
your sting out at me?” said the other.
“That’s just as you please to take it.”
“Sir, that’s a downright insult.” “Very
well, sir, I can’t help that.” “Draw,
then, and defend yourself!” Upon this
challenge, like other duellists, they made
a great bluster, and while they prepared
for battle with an air of great courage,
meanly took great pains to get the advantage
of ground and position. After
several passes, one was mortally wounded:
they then made up, and while one
expired, the other, in the most chivalrous
manner, said he was a gentleman. So
the musquito died with satisfaction.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Kahira, or Cairo.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> city, which is the capital of Modern
Egypt, is situated in a plain between
the eastern bank of the river
Nile and the ridge of Mokattam. It
occupies about three square miles, and is
surrounded by a wall, and commanded
by a large citadel, where the pacha resides.
The streets are unpaved and
narrow, some of them having rows of
shops on each side.</p>

<p>The roofs of the houses are flat, and
covered with plaster. The ground floor
apartments next the street have small
wooden grated windows; but those of
the upper stories are formed of wooden
lattice-work, which is so close that it
shuts out much of the light of the sun,
but admits the air. In the better houses,
the windows are furnished with frames
of glass in the inside; these are closed
in the winter.</p>

<p>There are many public buildings in
Kahira. The mosques are numerous,
and some of them distinguished for their
size, architecture, and great age. There
are also many public baths, which are
handsomely ornamented and painted,
and in some parts paved with marble.
The public gardens are filled with groves
of orange and lemon trees, and the cemeteries
are also much used as promenades.</p>

<p>The population is estimated at twenty-four
thousand, consisting of natives,
Jews and strangers. The police maintained
in the metropolis is tolerably
strict. Malefactors are mostly employed
in the public works.</p>

<p>Kahira still maintains the reputation
of being the best school of Arabic literature,
theology and jurisprudence.
Schools for children are very numerous;
almost every mosque has a <span class="dfn">koottab</span>, or
day school attached to it, in which children
are instructed in reading the Koran,
and in writing and arithmetic.</p>

CHILI.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">C<span class="smcap">hili</span> lies south of Peru, and is a narrow
tract about twelve hundred
miles in length, between the Pacific
ocean and the Andes. It has
a climate remarkably fine and salubrious,
and a soil which is very fertile.
It seldom rains there, but the dews are
abundant. In several parts of the Andes,
volcanoes yearly spout forth their
fires, and earthquakes are frequent and
severe.</p>

<p>Chili was conquered by the Spaniards
many years since; but the conquest was
achieved with much difficulty. In the
native Chilese they found a bold and intrepid
people, who fought with desperate
courage, and continued the war for fifty
years.</p>

<p>The Spaniards who have settled Chili,
live principally in the northern part.
With these have mingled a few English,
French and Italians.</p>

<p>The Creoles, or the descendants of
the Spaniards, are generally well made,
honorable, intrepid and liberal; yet vain
and fond of pleasure. The men generally
dress in the French fashion; the
women in that of Peru. But the Chilese
ladies wear long gowns, and have a
more modest air. The Creole population
are very extravagant in dress and
in their manner of living. The common
people of the country lead a happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
and tranquil life. They are somewhat
gay, and fond of music and poetry.</p>

<p>About one half of Chili is still possessed
by tribes of the Aborigines, who
are called Araucanians. In many respects
they are an interesting people.
They are not tall, but strong and robust,
and intrepid warriors, devoted to their
country, and prodigal of their lives.
They are courteous, hospitable, faithful
to their engagements, grateful for benefits,
and generous and humane towards
the vanquished. Many of them, however,
are addicted to gaming and drunkenness.
Great feasts are sometimes
made by them, on which occasions they
are guilty of a most wasteful prodigality.</p>

<p>They are copper-colored, but somewhat
lighter than most of the northern
and central tribes. Their face is nearly
round, eyes small, noses flattened, but
the mouth well made, and the teeth
white and uniform. They have long,
black hair. They pluck out their beards
by the roots. Many of the women are
handsome; are seldom gray before sixty
or seventy, nor bald before eighty. It
is not uncommon to find among them
persons of more than a hundred years,
retaining their teeth, and sight, and
memory unimpaired.</p>

<p>Of their dress, we shall only say, that
it is generally tight or compact, consisting
of a shirt, with breeches, and a mantle
reaching to the knee. These are
generally of wool, and of a blue color;
though the mantle is sometimes red or
white. They ornament their heads with
plumes of feathers. The women wear
a gown reaching to the feet, but without
sleeves. It is bound round the waist
with a girdle, confined by a silver clasp
in front. Their hair is left to fall on
their shoulders, and is decorated with
brilliant stones. Bracelets, necklaces,
and rings are also worn, and most of the
lower classes have ornaments of silver.</p>

<p>These people do not live in villages,
but their habitations are generally at a
distance from each other, on the banks of
rivers. These are commonly surrounded
with trees, under the shade of which the
family take their meals. Many of the
men have several wives, each of whom
daily presents her husband with a dish
of food, cooked at her own fire. The
Araucanians are distinguished for their
horsemanship and for their eloquence.
For this last, their language is well
adapted.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">PATAGONIA.</p>

<p>Patagonia is the most southern country
in South America. It has never been
much explored; so that we can say but
little more about it, than that the northern
parts have a milder climate and a more
productive soil than the southern parts,
which are intensely cold. It is as cold
there as Cape Horn, or as it is in the
northern part of Canada. Of the inhabitants,
also, we can give no very particular
account. Some Europeans, however,
have visited them, during their voyages
of trade or discovery.</p>

<p>In 1764, Commodore Byron landed in
Patagonia, and had an interview with
the natives. They have always been
said to be <em>giants</em>, and he found them to
be so. They seemed to him to be generally
six feet and a half high, and some
of them quite seven feet. The tallest
Americans are seldom over six feet;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
generally not more than five feet, and
seven and ten inches.</p>

<p>He found them not only thus tall, but
very robust. Only their hands and feet
are small. They are a warlike tribe,
yet courteous and humane. In their
complexion, they are copper-colored.
They have straight, black, and coarse
hair, usually tied behind with a string.
They paint themselves with circles round
the eyes, and with various colors. Their
teeth are exceedingly white, and remarkably
even and well set.</p>

<p>Their dress is made of the skin of the
guanaco, sewed together into pieces
about six feet long and five broad, which
are wrapped as a cloak round their body.
The upper part, however, falls back, and
thus exposes the neck and shoulders to
the weather, and makes them look almost
naked. They appear to eat raw
flesh of animals. They are excellent
horsemen, and will pursue their game
on horseback, in places of danger, where
an American would be afraid to go.</p>

<p>In 1766, Captain Welles visited Patagonia,
and while there, he took several
of the people on board his ship; but he
was surprised to find that they had no
curiosity about anything, excepting a
looking-glass, before which they danced
and played a thousand tricks.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">TERRA DEL FUEGO.</p>

<p>Of Terra del Fuego and its inhabitants,
we know still less than of Patagonia,
and the people of that country. It is
an island, separated from Cape Horn by
a strait, called the straits of Magellan,
after the navigator who first discovered
it. The same navigator gave the name
of Terra del Fuego to the island. It
signifies “<span class="dfn">the land of fire</span>,” and was
given to the island because he and his
men discovered on it numerous fires,
which proceeded from volcanoes.</p>

<p>The island is a dreary region; bleak,
barren, and mountainous. Winter reigns
here nearly the whole year round. The
inhabitants are of a middle stature, with
broad faces, flat noses, and high cheekbones.
They paint their bodies, which
are naturally fair, and what clothes they
wear are made of seals’ skins. Shell
fish is their principal food. Their huts
are miserable shelters, built in a conical
form, or much like a tunnel.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the north seem to
be quite different from those of the
south. The former are said to be cruel
and treacherous; the latter harmless and
simple. They are alike destitute of curiosity,
however, and although the climate
is extremely cold, they go almost
naked.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">Small Matters.</span>—The nerve of a
tooth, not as large as the finest cambric
needle, will sometimes drive a strong
man to distraction. A musqueto can
make an elephant absolutely mad. The
coral rock, causing a navy to founder, is
the work of worms. The warrior that
withstood death in a thousand forms
may be killed by an insect. The deepest
wretchedness results from a perpetual
continuance of petty trials. A
chance look from those we love, often
produces exquisite pain or unalloyed
pleasure.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Bat Family.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> family of bats is very numerous,
and some of its members are queer
characters, as we shall presently
show. They have puzzled the naturalists
not a little; for while they have
the structure of quadrupeds, they have
the motion of birds. They are the only
creatures that unite these two qualities.
There are such things, indeed, as flying
squirrels, and flying opossums, but these
do not raise themselves by wings; they
only support their bodies by spreading
out skinny membranes on either side, in
descending from an elevation, and are
thus able to make a long, sloping leap.</p>

<p>The bat, on the contrary, raises himself
into the air by his wings, and glances
about hither and thither, with all the
ease and vivacity of a bird. Yet this
creature has no feathers. He is covered
with hair, and when his skinny
wings are folded up, he looks very much
like a mouse or a mole. He even squeaks
like a mouse, and thus an appearance
of veracity is given to the fable of La
Fontaine. In this, the bat is represented
as having, on a certain occasion, got
into the nest of a weasel, the sworn enemy
of birds. When the weasel was about
to destroy him as one of the feathered
tribe, the little fellow escaped by representing
himself to be a mouse. Afterwards,
coming in the way of the cat, he
was upon the point of being devoured as
a mouse; but he now showed his wings,
and was let off, on the plea of being a bird.</p>

<p>In a former number, we have spoken
of the vampire, which is found in Guiana,
and have made mention, also, of certain
other species of this curious tribe.</p>

<p>We now proceed to speak of the general
habits of the whole race. They
frequent caverns, dark ravines, and crevices
of rocks. Here they sleep by day,
but, as evening approaches, they sally
forth, pursuing such insects as have not
gone to their repose. They are active
and busy during the warm season, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
when the cold evenings of autumn set
in, they retire to their dim retreats, where
they often cluster together by hundreds.
Here they remain in a dormant state
during the winter. In this condition
they show the greatest sensibility to the
touch, and their bodies even shrink from
the approach of the hand, before it comes
in contact with the body. Yet nothing
can rouse them from their profound sleep.</p>

<p>There are nearly one hundred and
fifty different kinds of bats. In this
country they are small in size, and comparatively
few in number. In tropical
regions they are more numerous, and in
some places, they fill the air so thickly,
as to increase the gloom of twilight. In
India there is a species, called flying
foxes, whose outstretched wings measure
six feet from tip to tip.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Joshua commanding the Sun and Moon to stand still.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">ne</span> of the most remarkable events
mentioned in Scripture, is that to
which the preceding picture relates.
It has often been the subject of the
painter’s pencil, and gives ample scope
for the exercise of his highest talent.
The story, as related in the tenth chapter
of Joshua, presents a scene of the
utmost sublimity. The Israelites having
fled out of Egypt, after forty years’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
wandering, had been conducted by Moses
to the borders of Canaan. This
great leader having died in the land of
Moab, Joshua became the chief of the
nation. Under his guidance they entered
the promised land. In the course
of their march they were met by the
kings of the Amorites, who attacked
them in the mountains. Encouraged
by divine assurance of success, Joshua
withstood the host, and a terrible conflict
ensued. The Israelites prevailed,
and a miracle, or what seemed a miracle,
was wrought in behalf of Joshua
and his army. The Amorites were defeated,
and Joshua, obeying the divine
command, stretched forth his hand, and
said, “Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon,
and thou moon in the valley of
Ajalon!” Obedient to this injunction,
the sun and the moon paused in their
course; the day was prolonged, and the
Israelites continued to pursue and cut
down their enemies.</p>

<p>There is something in the idea of a
great battle, where thousands of men
are engaged in the deadly conflict, and
of which the Creator is a spectator, and
at whose command even the mighty
orbs which give light and heat to the
universe are stayed in their path, which
excites the imagination, and lifts the
mind to the loftiest pitch of excitement.
The subject is, indeed, almost too grand
for human conception, and not even the
creative pencil of the painter can fully
master it.</p>

<p class="flushright"><i>Baton Rouge, La., April, 1844.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Robert Merry</span>: <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—We take pleasure
in declaring to you that your name and the fame
of your periodical have at length reached us
here in the far south-west. And from the spirit
of kind good-nature which seems to mark all
your communications with your young friends,
we are ready to think that you will not spurn
the salutations of your new acquaintances in
Louisiana. Though this may be the first voice
from the “Creole State,” we hope it will not be
the last. We would have you and all your readers
down east, and north, and all other parts
of our great country, understand that we are
not exactly in a barbarous state—nor approaching
it—as we mean to show by patronizing the
Museum.</p>

<p>That good old gentleman, Peter Parley, has
long since become a favorite among us; and it
was only necessary to be informed that you were
his near kinsman or intimate friend, that you
enjoyed his confidence, and are even intrusted
with all the precious relics left by him,—to
secure you the most ready reception and all that
generous hospitality in which the people of our
state abound. We have often heard of that
place “away down east,” called Boston; and
especially how many fine schools, and books,
and all such useful things, our young friends
there enjoy; and since we found out the characters
of Peter Parley and Robert Merry among
others of your distinguished citizens, our curiosity
is more excited, and, no doubt, many of us
will be led to come and see that part of the land
if we live to grow up. But if we do, we wish
very much not to appear behind others of your
black-eyed and blue-eyed friends in intelligence.
Therefore we mean to have your interesting
and instructive publication, which, with other
improvements that are being made in our means
of instruction, we think, will help us to keep up
with the age, and prepare to act our part as well
as the Yankee boys and girls.</p>

<p>Now we don’t like to make promises, any
more than yourself; but just to encourage you
we will give you a <em>hint</em> at <em>least</em>. You know we
raise <em>sugar cane</em> in this state; and we are told
that you and your northern readers know nothing
about <em>making</em> sugar, but only <em>eating</em> it.
Now, if you have a sweet tooth, (for we hope
you havn’t become toothless yet,) you wouldn’t
despise a barrel of the finest sugar or the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
<em>sirop</em> from some plantation in this vicinity—if
you should happen to find one on some of your
Boston ships, <em>especially</em>, should it be accompanied
by a description of the process of making
it, for the benefit of all your little <em>sweet-loving</em>
readers. Hoping, then, that you will punctually
furnish <em>us</em>, as well as your older and nearer

to distribute, we make our bow as</p>

<p>We thank Pierce L. H. of Brooklyn, N. York,
and our friend P., for their communications.</p>

<p>Sarah C. F. is satisfied with our reasons why
the eastern coast of America has a colder climate
than the western coast of Europe, but
wonders that Kamskatka is so much colder than
Alaska—both being in the same latitude. She
will find an explanation in the fact that the latter
is a mere island, and the surrounding ocean
moderates and equalizes the temperature.
Kamskatka, it is true, is near the sea, but it
is contiguous to Siberia, which is an extensive
mass of unbroken land, which is always colder
than the sea.</p>

<p>The tenth of August is the festival of
St. Lawrence. He suffered martyrdom
at Rome, being roasted to death on a red-hot
grate of iron. The church of St.
Lawrence in London is dedicated to him,
and has a gridiron on the steeple for a
vane.</p>

<p>The fifteenth of this month is what is
called <em>Assumpsion day</em> by the Catholics.
It is a great festival with them, and is
designed to commemorate the assumption,
or taking up of the Virgin Mary
into heaven. It is one of the most famous
of the Romish festivals, and is celebrated
in France, Italy, and other Catholic
countries, with processions, songs,
ceremonies, and every variety of religious
pageantry.</p>

<p>If we may be permitted to say a word
to the farmers, we would advise them to
declare a war of extermination on the
thistles in and about their premises. It
is said by some correct cultivators, that
if the Canada thistle is cut in August,
before its seed is ripe, it will die in an
accommodating manner; because the
stalk, which is hollow, will fill with
water and destroy the root.</p>

<p>It is also said, if you cut bushes in the
old of the moon in August, you will destroy
them root and branch. We doubt
if the moon will interfere in the matter;
but August is the best time for cutting
bushes, because vegetation having come
to a close for the season, the bushes will
not so readily sprout again from the
roots.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Bill and the Boys.</h3>
<br>
<p class="center ls">DIRK HELDRIVER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I <span class="smcap">recollect</span>, one winter evening, when
Bill and myself, with three or four
young companions, were assembled
around the fire of the “Cock and
Bull,” it chanced to be Bill’s turn to tell
a story. It was a wild night, for the
wind blew, and the sleet rattled against
the windows, as the heavy gusts swept
round the corner of the old tavern.
When Bill was about to begin his story,
I could see that his cheek was a little
pale, and his eye glistened as if there
were something extraordinary in his
mind. At length, he began, and related
the following story, as nearly as I can
recollect it.</p>

<p>About sixty miles north of the city
of New York, a range of lofty highlands
crosses the Hudson, nearly from west to
east, which passes under the name of
the Fishkill mountains. The river has
cut away this mighty barrier for the
space of two or three miles, but it rises
on either side and lifts its blue summits
almost to the clouds. At the foot of the
eastern portion of this range is now the
pretty village of Fishkill, and scattered
along the banks of the river are the luxurious
country-seats of the De Wints,
Verplancks, and other old Dutch families.</p>

<p>But our story goes back for nearly a
century, to a period when there were
only a few scattered settlements along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
the banks of this noble river, and while
yet the savage, the bear, and the panther
were found in the forest. At this time, a
man, who bore the semblance of a gentleman,
purchased a large tract of land
along the bank of the river, and at the
distance of two or three miles from the
eastern branch of the mountains we have
described. Here he caused a large mansion
to be constructed in the Dutch fashion,
and having laid out his grounds
with considerable care, he removed
hither with his wife, and a large retinue
of servants. He bore the name of Hielder,
and supported the style and figure
of a man of fortune.</p>

<p>After a few years he had a child, a
daughter, which became the special object
of the care and attention of both
parents. Hielder himself was a somewhat
stern and gloomy man, and he
seemed to impress his character upon
everything around him. The mansion
was deeply imbedded in the tall trees,
and the apartments, wainscotted with oak
and feebly lighted, had a peculiarly sombre
aspect. The servants gradually assumed
a dark and mysterious look, and
the lady herself, though very beautiful,
was always dressed in black, and was
distinguished by a complexion of almost
deathlike paleness.</p>

<p>Several years passed, and the little
girl, who was named Katrina, might
now be seen walking with her mother
amid the long, straight, shady avenues
that were cut in the forest. Excepting
the persons connected with the establishment,
few persons visited the spot;
it was therefore marked with peculiar
loneliness, which seemed to increase
the gloomy and mysterious aspect of the
place. The proprietor of the mansion
had no intercourse whatever with the
people of the vicinity, and never, except
once a year, when he made a short visit
to the city of New York, did he leave
his residence. He spent much of his
time in reading, and devoted several
hours each day to the instruction of his
child, who now seemed to be the only
object of his affections. It appeared
indeed that there was some deep-rooted
bitterness at his heart, which he attempted
to alleviate by the education of his
daughter.</p>

<p>The child was indeed worthy of all
his care, yet she seemed the very opposite
of everything around her. She had
light, flaxen hair, blue eyes, snowy complexion,
and an ever-laughing expression
of countenance. Seated in the gloomy
library with her father, she seemed like
a spot of playful sunshine, lighting the
recesses of a cavern.</p>

<p>It was remarkable, that although she
was the favorite of all around, and evidently
the object of the deepest interest
to her parents, the father still seemed
not to reflect from his own heart any
portion of the child’s cheerfulness and
vivacity. Though she romped, frolicked,
laughed and toyed, a ray of pleasure, or
even a passing smile never lighted his
countenance. Her spirit shone upon
him, but it was like light falling upon a
black surface, which absorbed, but did
not throw back, its rays. A keen observer,
indeed, would have said that the moody
father felt even a rebuke in the joyous
gaiety of his child.</p>

<p>With the mother there was this difference,
that though she was generally sorrowful,
the springs of happiness seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
not wholly dried up. She felt a mother’s
pride in the surpassing beauty of the
child, and was often cheered by the little
creature’s hoyden mirth. In the presence
of the master, the servants were
habitually silent and gloomy. But if at
any time they found the little girl apart,
they not unfrequently indulged in a
game of romps.</p>

<p>Such was little Katrina, a playful,
happy creature, in the midst of shadows
and gloom—the idol of all, and apparently
the object in which the affections
of the parents, as well as the rest of the
household were centred. It was when
she had reached the age of about six
years, that an incident occurred of the
deepest interest. At the close of a summer
evening, a small sloop anchored in
the river, near the house we have described.
A boat was let down, and a
man, wrapped in a cloak, was landed
upon the beach. He proceeded to the
mansion, and, inquiring for the master,
was conducted to the library. The
room was vacant, but the stranger sat
down, and occupied himself in gazing
around the apartment. At length, the
proprietor came, his countenance being
marked with something of anxiety. The
stranger arose, laid aside his cloak, and
stood before his host. For a moment he
did not speak; but, at last, he said,
“You pass, I understand, by the name
of Hielder. I know your real name,
and I presume you know mine.”</p>

<p>“I know you not,” said Hielder,
sternly.</p>

<p>“Then you shall know me,” said the
stranger. “My name is Hieldover, the
victim of your perfidy, and I am here to
avenge my wrongs.”</p>

<p>“This is a pretty tale,” said Hielder;
“and you bear yourself bravely. Perhaps
you are one of Robert Kidd’s men,
and have come here in search of gold;
but you have mistaken your errand. I
have but to ring the bell, and my servants
will execute my will upon you.”</p>

<p>“This bullying will not answer your
purpose,” said Hieldover; “nothing
shall turn me from my purpose, which is
to extort from you the fortune that you
have obtained by the basest perfidy and
fraud. You pretend not to know me; I
will refresh your memory. Fifteen
years since you were made my guardian
at Amsterdam, by my father’s will.
You possessed yourself, by forgery,
of my ample fortune. You departed
from the country in secrecy, and I was
left a beggar. I have since been a wanderer
over the earth, and have known
toil, and suffering, and sorrow, while
you have been revelling in the wealth
which was mine. I have traced you
through the four quarters of the globe,
and had sworn in my heart to follow
upon your track like the bloodhound, till
I could find you and bring you to justice.”</p>

<p>During this speech, the pale countenance
of Hielder was frequently flushed
with anger. At last, he said, sneeringly,
“You have spoken freely—have you
done? If so, I will show you the door.”
Hieldover seemed to be on the point
of giving vent to his rage; but he
checked himself, and said, “You deny
my claim, then? You refuse to do me
justice?”</p>

<p>“I have no answer to make,” said
Hielder, “to an idle braggart.”</p>

<p>“Beware, then, of my vengeance,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
said the other, clenching his fist, and
looking defiance in the eye of Hielder.
He then took his leave.</p>

<p>This scene passed without the knowledge
of any individual, except the parties
concerned. Yet for several days the
master of the house seemed even more
gloomy than usual. He spoke little to
any one, and remained almost wholly in
the seclusion of his library. After a
month, however, had passed away, he
seemed to be restored to his former condition,
and resumed his wonted occupations.
He seemed more than ever devoted to
his child, although he maintained his
accustomed sternness. For a time he
would hardly allow the child to be out
of his presence, but at length the mother
was permitted to resume her walks, attended
by her daughter.</p>

<p>One day, she went out in the morning,
but did not return at the usual hour.
Some anxiety was excited, and the servants
were sent forth in search of their
mistress and the child. They returned
without being able to find her. All was
now alarm. Hielder himself went forth,
and the people were directed to scour
the woods in every direction. They
soon brought tidings to their master that
the lady was found, but the child was
missing. When discovered, she was insensible;
but when she came to herself,
she stated that while she was walking
in the woods, a stranger suddenly sprung
upon the child, and bore it away. He
fled toward the mountains, and she pursued
till she swooned and fell to the
ground. Here she remained, in a state
of insensibility, till she was taken up by
the people who were in search of her.</p>

says Barrington, in his memoirs,
“once related, with infinite humor,
an adventure between him and a mastiff,
when he was a boy. He had heard
somebody say, that any person, throwing
the skirts of his coat over his head,
stooping low, holding out his arms, and
creeping along backwards, might frighten
the fiercest dog, and put him to flight.
He accordingly made the attempt on a
miller’s animal in the neighborhood, who
<em>would never let the boys rob the orchard</em>;
but he found to his sorrow, that he had
a dog to deal with, who did not care
which end of a boy went first, so that he
could get a good bite of it.</p>

<p>“‘I pursued the instructions,’ said Curran;
‘and as I had no eyes save those
in front, I fancied the mastiff was in full
retreat, but I was painfully mistaken;
for, at the very moment I fancied myself
victorious, the enemy attacked my rear,
and, having got a reasonably good
mouthful of it, was fully prepared to
take another, before I was rescued.’”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The River Nile.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> whole northeastern part of Africa
consists of a mighty expanse of desert
sand, extending for upwards of a
thousand miles in each direction.
The chains of wild and rocky mountains
by which it is traversed, give only a more
rugged and dreary character to this immense
waste. One vast feature alone
breaks this terrible monotony. From
the high chains of Abyssinia, and from
the still loftier mountains of the moon,
that traverse Central Africa, descend numerous
and ample streams, which, long
before entering Egypt, unite in forming
the Nile, a river of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>Although the Nile in its whole progress
through this desert does not receive
the <a id="chg4"></a>accession of a single rivulet, it brings
so vast an original store as enables it to
reach and pour a mighty stream into the
Mediterranean. For many hundred
miles in the upper part of its course,
confined between high and rocky banks,
it is merely bordered by a brilliant belt of
fertility, the sandy waste stretching indefinitely
on both sides; this is Nubia.</p>

<p>After traversing the barrier of the cataracts,
it passes through a broader valley
between mountains of some height, and
on its banks are many shaded or inundated
tracts, which yield products of considerable
value; this is Upper Egypt.
Emerging from these mountains, the
Nile enters a flat and extensive plain,
where it separates, and by two great and
divided streams, with various intersecting
branches, enters the Mediterranean;
this is Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>In the last part of its course, the Nile
is nearly on a level with the district
which it intersects, and when swelled by
the autumnal rains of Central Africa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
overflows it entirely. The waters begin
to rise about the 18th or 19th of June,
attain their greatest height in September,
and subside as gradually as they rise,
and within about an equal space of time.
The land thus covered with the fertilizing
alluvial deposit, collected during so long
a course, becomes the most productive,
perhaps, on the face of the globe; and
notwithstanding its limited extent, and the
mighty wastes on which it borders, has always
maintained a numerous population.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the fertility of
Egypt is solely dependent on the Nile,
and that, but for this, it would be, like
the rest of Africa in this quarter, a sandy
and desolate waste.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">
The Old Man in the Corner.</h3>

<p class="center allsmcap">THE PHILOSOPHER REBUKED.</p>

<p>There was once a learned man, or
philosopher, who was fond of prying
into the works of nature, and every
other source of knowledge. At last
he became vain of his great stores of
information, and was somewhat rash in
forming his opinions.</p>

<p>One evening, as this philosopher was
conversing with a friend, the discourse
turned upon the Bible, and the former
declared that he did not believe in it. A
somewhat warm dispute ensued, in the
course of which the philosopher said that
he rejected the Bible, because it contained
many doctrines which he could not comprehend;
“and <em>I make it a rule</em>,” said
he emphatically, “<em>never to believe anything
which I cannot understand</em>.”</p>

<p>It happened that there was a little girl
in the room, the daughter of the philosopher.
She was about eight years old,
and though of a lively and playful turn,
she was remarkably intelligent and observing.
While the father and his friend
were engaged in conversation, she was
occupied with her toys upon the floor,
and seemed absorbed in her sports.
Yet she listened to the discourse, and
though she did not understand it all,
yet she caught the remark of her father
which we have noticed above, and treasured
it up in her heart. She also noticed
the inferences which her father drew
from the proposition to which we have
alluded.</p>

<p>Without paying the least attention to
the little girl, the gentlemen pursued
their conversation, and the philosopher
declared, that, as he could not understand
how the death of Christ could contribute
to the salvation of the sinner, he rejected
the doctrine of the atonement, as unworthy
of belief.</p>

<p>“It appears to me,” said his friend,
“that if you reject everything which you
cannot wholly conceive or comprehend,
you must not only reject the Bible, but
adopt the views of the atheist, and deny
the existence of a God.” The philosopher
admitted the force of this observation,
and declared, that, as he had no
sensible, or visible, proof of the existence
of the Deity, he disbelieved the existence
of such a Being.</p>

<p>Thus far the watchful ear and quick
sense of the child caught and comprehended
the conversation, and as her
mother had given her a religious education,
she was not a little startled and
surprised at the opinions which her
father had uttered.</p>

<p>She said nothing about it, however, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
the time, and two or three weeks passed
before she gave any indications of having
noticed the conversation. She was one
day walking with her father, when they
chanced to discover a single violet—the
first they had seen, for it was the beginning
of spring. She stooped down to pick
it, but paused a moment, and looking
her father in the face, inquired, “What
makes this little flower grow, father?”</p>

<p>“The heat and moisture and the principle
of vegetable life,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“But how does it grow?” said she.
“Can heat and water and seeds make a
flower?”</p>

<p>“It is the course of nature, my child,”
said the philosopher.</p>

<p>“But I want to know,” said she, “what
this course of nature is? I want to know
how it operates? Is nature alive? Has
it power to make flowers? and by what
means does it work?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, child,” was the
answer. “We do not understand these
things,—we only know the fact that such
things are.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you believe that the
flower grows, father?” said the child.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the reply. “Why
do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because I heard you tell Mr. B., the
other day, that you never believed anything
you could not understand.”</p>

<p>The philosopher here turned the conversation,
and they walked on.</p>

<p>A few days after this the child was
taken sick of a fever. As she lay upon
her bed, she could distinctly feel the
beatings of her heart, which shook her
whole frame. Her father was by the bedside.
Though suffering from disease, the
mind of the little girl was perfectly clear.</p>

<p>“What makes the heart beat?” said
she to her father.</p>

<p>“It is the principle of life,” said he.</p>

<p>“And what is this principle of life?”
said the child.</p>

<p>“I cannot explain it to you,” said the
philosopher; “we do not comprehend it;
we only know that there is such a thing,
and that by its impulse the heart beats
and the blood circulates.”</p>

<p>“Put your hand on my breast,” said
the child. The father did as requested.</p>

<p>“Does not my heart beat, father?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“And yet you cannot comprehend
how this is. You said we must believe
nothing which we cannot explain. Yet
I know that my heart beats, though you
cannot tell me how, or why. Dear father,
may I not believe in a God, though I
cannot comprehend his nature or existence;
and may I not believe in the
Bible, and its wonderful doctrines, even
though they may be beyond my feeble
reason?”</p>

<p>The philosopher stood rebuked, but
again he turned the conversation.</p>

<p>The fever which had attacked the
little girl proceeded in its rapid course,
and in a few days she drew near her
end. As her spirit was about to depart,
she called, in a faint whisper, for her
father. He placed his ear near to her
lips, and caught her last words; “Father,
may I not believe that Christ died for
sinners? may I not believe, though I
cannot fully comprehend, the doctrine of
the atonement?”</p>

<p>The philosopher wept, and answered,
“Believe, my child; you have conquered
my unbelief!”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Hunting Leopard.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> handsome animal of the Cat family,—sometimes
called the <span class="dfn">Ounce</span>, and
also the <span class="dfn">Chetah</span>,—is of the size of a
large dog, and has a very long tail.
It is of a pale yellow above and white beneath,—the
body being marked with
irregular black spots. It is of a slender
make, and its agility is surprising. It is
less ferocious than the tiger, panther and
true leopard; and having blunted claws,
like a dog, is used, in the southern parts
of Asia, for hunting the antelope and other
game. It is a native, also, of Africa, but
it has never been trained for this purpose.</p>

<p>The chetah is chiefly used in hunting
by the nobles of India. The mode of
proceeding is thus described. The animals
are carried to the field in low chariots,
being tied and hooded. This is
done in order to deprive them of the
power and temptation to anticipate the
word of command by leaping forth before
the appointed time. When they are thus
brought within view of a herd of antelopes,
which generally consists of five or
six females and a male, they are unchained,
and their hoods are removed,
their keeper directing their attention to
the prey, which, as they do not hunt by
smell, it is necessary that they should
constantly have in sight.</p>

<p>When this is done, the wily animal does
not at once start forward towards the object
of his pursuit, but, seemingly aware
that he would have no chance of overtaking
an antelope in the fleetness of the
race, in which the latter is beyond measure
his superior, winds cautiously along
the ground, concealing himself as much
as possible from sight, and, when he has
in this covert manner nearly reached the
unsuspecting herd, breaks forth upon
them unawares, and, after five or six
tremendous bounds, which he executes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
with almost incredible velocity, darts at
once upon his terrified victim, strangles
him in an instant, and takes his fill of
blood.</p>

<p>In the mean while the keeper quietly
approaches the scene of slaughter, caresses
the successful animal, and throws to
him pieces of meat to amuse him and
keep him quiet while he blinds him with
the hood, and replaces him upon the
chariot, to which he is again attached by
the chain. But if, as is not unfrequently
the case, the herd should have taken the
alarm, and the chetah should prove unsuccessful
in his attack, he never attempts
to pursue them, but returns to his
master with a mortified and dejected air,
to be again let slip at a fresh quarry
whenever a fit opportunity occurs.</p>

Conjugal Affection.</h3>

<p class="center">CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
<br>
[Concluded.]</p>

<p class="drop-cap">V<span class="smcap">ictoria</span> immediately saw the propriety
of the latter suggestion, and on the
following day she disguised herself
as a Moorish fruit-seller; and with a
basket of vegetables on her head, and
her little daughter by her side disguised
in the same manner, she got admittance
to the outward wards of the castle; and
while disposing of her fruit to the governor
and his dependants, got into conversation
with the soldiery, from whom,
however, she could obtain none of the
information she wanted.</p>

<p>Her whole time was now occupied by
day in visiting the prison in the disguise
she had assumed; and at night in keeping
up the correspondence of so much
importance. By this means, at the suggestion
of Albert, she supplied him, not
only with writing materials, but with a
file, a chisel, and a hammer; and had
got even a rope in readiness, should it be
required for future operation.</p>

<p>Albert had in the first instance thought
of breaking through the walls of his
dungeon; but alas! they were eighteen
feet thick, and no effort that he could
make upon them with the slight tools
he possessed, was sufficient to separate
them. He had, with great caution, taken
out two or three stones in the wall of his
dungeon, but the interior stones were so
firmly wedged, that they defied him.
The labor of his task was enormous;
and this was increased from the necessity
of replacing every stone in its respective
niche, so as to escape the vigilant
eye of the keepers. So, at last, poor
Albert began to despair.</p>

<p>Victoria, however, whose inventions
were more fertile than those of her husband,
still comforted him. She told him
that she would never desist in her exertions
while he remained a prisoner, and
bade him have hope and trust. He,
however, had little reason to hope, for
he was told by one of his guards, that
on the next day, he was to be examined
for the fourth time.</p>

<p>And examined he was. Torn from
his dungeon at midnight, he was again
brought before the Inquisition. The examiners
sat before him, in a room hung
with black. Behind the chair of the
chief commissioner, who wore a square
cap, shone, in all the brilliance of pure
white silver, an image of the crucified
Redeemer; and beneath it, a skull and
cross bones. The marquis was bound,
and without being asked a single question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
was placed at once upon a rack
in the corner of the room. A physician
stood by his side to watch his agonies,
and to stop the torture when beyond
human endurance; and the secretary of
the fraternity sat ready to record the
answers to the questions put to the unhappy
man.</p>

<p>Thus tortured to confess crimes which
he never committed, the marquis had
every bone dislocated; and when nature
gave up the contest, and he sunk into
stupor, he was removed back to his dungeon.
For some days, he remained in
the most helpless condition, without
being able to move a limb, except in
exquisite torture. Yet, after a time, his
system recovered its wonted strength,
and Albert was again inspired with hope.</p>

<p>Victoria Colonna had pursued the
same course of communication previously
adopted for several successive
days, and receiving no answer to her
signs, was at last on the brink of despair.
She believed that the wickedness of man
had done its worst, and that her husband
had escaped by death from the power
of the tormentor. Day after day, she
watched with anxious longing for some
sign of his still being an inhabitant of
the earth; but no sign was given to her,
and she was on the point of giving up
all further exertions, when on one of her
nightly walks and watchings round the
captive’s tower, her ear was delighted
with the well-known clatter of a piece
of tile. She ran to the spot, and once
more recognized the well-known handwriting
of Albert—“I still live for Victoria,”
was the only sentence inscribed
by the unhappy prisoner.</p>

<p>The faithful wife now lost not a moment
in devising some other plan for
her husband’s escape. She pondered
all the next day, and part of the next
night. As soon as it was dark, she
again raised her kite by the side of the
tower, placed a note under its wing, in
which she bade her husband be of good
cheer, promising all her assistance, and
suggesting his making a breach in the
wall with the implements already afforded
him. To this, on the following
night, Albert replied, stating the utter
impracticability of the plan, by reason
of the thickness of the wall; but urging
her to procure a sufficient quantity of
gunpowder, by which the masses of
stone might be separated and a breach
made.</p>

<p>Victoria seized the hint, and with the
rapidity of thought, made her arrangements.
By means of the kite, the following
night, a stouter line was raised
to the aperture, and from this, one still
stronger; and by means of the last, the
prisoner drew up several other cutting
implements—a boring auger, and several
parcels of gunpowder. Lastly, a still
larger cord was drawn up; and it was
then arranged that on the following
night, the attempt should be made to
blast the massive walls of the tower.</p>

<p>The next day, Victoria was busily
employed in arranging the means of
escape. She had procured the dress
of a friar, both for herself and husband,
and wore one over the other; and at
midnight, she again took her station
below the tower. Again she established
the communication between herself and
husband; and having raised to himself
several other packets of gunpowder,
lastly had fastened to the cord the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
lighted match. But at the very moment
of success, she found a strong arm
grasping her, and two ruffian soldiers,
with unsheathed weapons, close at her
breast. She screamed fearfully. The
words—“bind her,” startled her still
more, for it was the voice of Montalbert,
the wretch who had caused the imprisonment
of her husband.</p>

<p>“Drag her away,” said the count.</p>

<p>Victoria clung to the projecting walls
of the castle, having fixed her fingers
within a clamping-iron, and hung to it
with the tenacity of one who clings to
life; while her screams and lamentations
filled the air. Albert heard it,
and judged of the cause. He applied
the match to the mine he had pierced
through the stones of the tower. With
a tremendous crack and explosion, the
ancient walls opened, shook, collapsed,
and fell. The tower was shattered to its
foundation; and prisoner and dungeon,
turret and battlement, fell down in one
prodigious ruin, and with an uproar that
shook the city.</p>

<p>Montalbert lay dead among the ruins.
The faithful Victoria was miraculously
saved, and Albert rose from the fallen
stones uninjured. He clasped his beloved
wife to his heart, and without
losing a moment’s time, both escaped in
the confusion and consternation that followed.</p>

<p>They soon proceeded far from Italy,
to a land where imprisonment for conscience
sake is unknown, where spiritual
domination cannot usurp nature’s rights;
and where the children of God can walk
in security and peace; and that land was
England. Here they lived the remainder
of their days in all the enjoyment
which this country of true liberty always
affords to the fugitive and stranger.</p>

indeed, a man of great genius to design
and carry forward so stupendous a work.
The building was one hundred and fifteen
years in progress, and extended
through the reigns of no less than eighteen
popes. The cost of it was amazing,
being equal to one hundred and sixty
millions of dollars at the present day.
A period of one hundred and fifty years
or more was required to complete the
colonnade and other ornaments after the
body of the structure was finished. Great
numbers of people are now constantly at
work to keep the enormous mass in repair.
The annual expense of this is
estimated at thirty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The clear length of the church within
is 615 feet, its utmost breadth 448, its
height 464 feet. The greater part of it
is of stone, though some portion is of
marble. The foundations are immense,
and it is said that they contain a greater
mass of stone than the building above
the ground. In front of the church, and
within the colonnade, is a beautiful obelisk,
brought from Egypt almost two
thousand years ago. On each side of
this is a fountain, the waters of which
rise to the height of seventy feet and fall
in three cascades; the whole forming a
cone of falling waters. They continue
to fall day and night, and nothing can
be more beautiful than the effect produced.
They are supplied by ancient
Roman aqueducts, from lake Braccano,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
which is seventeen miles distant. Every
thing is vast in and about this wonderful
edifice. The interior is very grand, and
strikes the beholder with awe. The
figures of the four Evangelists, which
adorn the inside of the cupola, are of
such enormous size, that the pen in the
hand of St. Mark is six feet long. The
interior is enriched with a great number
of figures of saints and other works of
art. In the centre of the church, where
the light pours down from the dome, is
the tomb of St. Peter, before which
one hundred lamps are kept constantly
burning.</p>

<p>Some idea of the vastness of this
structure may be formed from the fact
that great numbers of persons live upon
the roof, in buildings which are not seen
from below, yet appear almost like the
streets of a city!</p>

Fortune-Telling.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> desire of looking into futurity—of
knowing what is going to happen—appears
to be universal in mankind.
To a certain extent, we may gratify
this feeling, but it is to be done by the
exercise of a sound judgment. We may
thus generally tell what is coming to
pass, in respect to most important transactions
of life, so far as is necessary
for us.</p>

<p>But many people desire to go farther;
to unseal the book of fate, and read what
is hidden from mortal sight. Young
ladies often desire to know who they
shall have for husbands: whether they
shall be rich or poor; happy or miserable.
And instead of leaving these things to
time, and the dispensation of Providence,
they must often go to some cheat who
pretends to tell fortunes. Thus they lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
their time and their money, and allow
themselves to play the part of folly.</p>

<p>Nor are young ladies the only persons
who sometimes yield to such idle nonsense.
Young men often do the same—and
also old men and old women. It is,
I believe, a common notion, that certain
strange, odd, eccentric, mysterious persons
have the power of reading the future
and telling what is coming to pass. So
common is this shallow superstition, that
fortune-tellers, though they require a
good deal of money, to read their riddles,
often find pretty good encouragement.</p>

<p>These jugglers generally pretend to
tell the fortunes of persons by the stars,
or by looking at the lines in the palm of
the hand, or by the cast of the countenance,
or by all these means combined.
They frequently consult books with
strange figures in them; and sometimes
they seem to make profound calculations.
But all these are mere arts to impose
upon their dupes. The simple fact is,
that fortune-telling is, always and under
all circumstances, a cheat. One person
can see into the future as well as another,
as to all that lies beyond the sagacity of
mere human judgment. A person who
believes, therefore, that any one has the
art or gift of fortune-telling, is the victim
of superstition, and the dupe of artifice.</p>

<p>In England, Spain and Germany there
are a few wandering people called Gypsies.
They are of a dark skin, almost
like our Indians: they have black hair,
black eyes, and altogether a dark and
wild aspect. They speak a strange
tongue, have strange habits, and are a
very peculiar people.</p>

<p>The women of this race very often
pretend to be fortune-tellers. They have
great address in making their dupes believe
in their mysterious power. They
frequently gain some information as to
the history of a person; then, presenting
themselves before him, offer to tell his
fortune. Affecting to know nothing of
him—never to have seen him before—they
proceed to weave the web of fate;
taking care to mingle in some real incidents
of his life. The person thus is
amazed to find the strange Gypsy, who
has never seen him before, telling accurately
the leading circumstances of his
history; and as she seems to read the
past by her mysterious art—he thinks,
by the same power, she can of course
unravel the future!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Life of Martin Luther.</h3>

<p class="center small">(Continued.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> Luther was fully informed of
the operations of Tetzel and his associates,
he drew up certain themes
or propositions, setting forth his
own views of the powers of the church,
and denouncing the avarice, impudence
and licentiousness of the priests who
went about selling indulgences and extorting
money, under the pretence of
making collections for the church.</p>

<p>Though there was nothing in these
themes, but what many Catholics had
maintained, they assailed in some points,
especially the favorite doctrine of infallibility,
the accepted creed of that day.
He, however, boldly published them,
challenged reply, and defended them in
his own pulpit. Multitudes gathered to
hear him, and his opinions were rapidly
spread over Europe.</p>

<p>Tetzel and his associates were greatly
enraged; they formally burnt Luther’s
theses, and then proceeded to answer
them, chiefly by assuming the supreme
authority and infallibility of the pope.
This injured their cause, and their reply
to Luther was publicly burnt by
the students of Wittemberg. Such was
the beginning of the storm which shook
Europe to its foundation, and finally
stripped the pope of his spiritual supremacy.
Yet, when Leo heard of the
dispute at Wittemberg, he only said, “It is
a quarrel between monks;—but brother
Luther seems to be a man of parts!”</p>

<p>Luther’s fame was rapidly extended,
but as yet he had no idea of separating
from the Church of Rome. In 1518, he
wrote a submissive letter to the pope, in
which he says, “I throw myself prostrate
at your feet, most holy father: call or
recall me, condemn or approve, as you
please: I shall acknowledge your voice
as the voice of Christ, who presides and
speaks in your person.”</p>

<p>But the pope, who had once thought
so lightly of Luther’s influence, was ere
long seriously alarmed, and at last summoned
him to appear at Rome, to be
examined, within sixty days. The danger
to Luther in doing this was obvious,
and his friend the Elector of Saxony
obtained permission to have his examination
take place at Augsburg. Here
Cardinal Cajetan, or Caietano, was commanded
to examine him. Thither Luther
went, accompanied by his friend Staupnitz.
The cardinal required a recantation
of what he had written; but this
Luther refused. Warned of danger that
threatened him, he left Augsburg, and
returned to Wittemberg. The pope
now issued a bull, declaring that he, as
Christ’s vicar on earth, had power to
deliver from all punishment due for sin,
to those who repented and were in a
state of grace, whether alive or dead.
Luther now appealed from the pope to a
general council of the church.</p>

<p>Pope Leo now commissioned a prelate,
named Milnitz, to endeavor to bring Luther
to a recantation. This dignitary
was a man of talent and skill, and in an
interview with Luther, he greatly conciliated
the feelings of the latter. Milnitz
condemned the abuse of the sale of
indulgences, threw the blame upon Tetzel
and his associates, and finally induced
Luther to write another submissive letter
to the pope, acknowledging that he had
carried his zeal too far, and promising to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
observe silence upon the matter in debate,
if his adversaries would adhere to
the same line of conduct. This letter
has subjected Luther to great scandal,
as a retraction of his principles; but it
must be regarded only as evidence of
the profound reverence with which he
regarded the institution of the Church of
Rome, in whose faith he had been educated,
and the difficulty with which his
mind burst asunder the fetters which it
had thrown around him. The pope
himself at this period wrote a kind letter
to Luther, and it is probable that the
breach might have been healed, had not
Luther’s enemies again opened the controversy.</p>

<p>Eckius of Ingoldstadt challenged Carolstadt,
one of Luther’s disciples, to an
open discussion at Leipsic. Luther went
thither himself, agreeing to take no part
in the disputation. The debate attracted
the great and the learned, from a vast
distance. Among the listeners was the
celebrated Melancthon, who was determined
by what he here heard to devote
himself to the cause of reform.</p>

<p>Eckius was a man of brilliant eloquence,
and seemed to have the advantage
of his antagonist, after a dispute of
six days. It was then agreed, by Eckius’
desire, that Luther himself should enter
the lists. The debate was continued for
several days, and different accounts were
given of the result; but Hoffmann, the
rector of the University of Leipsic, who
had been appointed judge of the disputation,
considering it to be so equally balanced,
that he refused to pronounce a
decision.</p>

<p>Luther went on to write several works,
mostly questioning the lofty assumptions
of the Church of Rome. He exposed
the fatuity of penance, and pilgrimages;
the impiety of worshipping saints; and
the abuses of the confessional; he condemned
the celibacy of priests, and denounced
monastic vows. Leo now assembled
a congregation of cardinals, before
whom Luther’s works were laid for adjudication.
By their advice, a bull was
drawn up, in which forty-one propositions,
taken from his books, were denounced
as heretical; his writings were
condemned to be publicly burnt, and
he himself was summoned to appear at
Rome, and retract his writings on pain
of excommunication. Luther again appealed
to a general council of the church;
and publicly separated himself from the
communion of the Church of Rome, by
burning the pope’s bull on a pile of
wood, without the walls of Wittemberg,
in presence of a vast multitude of people.
This occurred, December 10th, 1520.
Soon after, the pope thundered against
him his bull of excommunication.</p>

<p>The situation of the great Reformer
was now one to put his moral courage
to the severest test. Staupnitz, his early
friend, had deserted him, and made
peace with the church; Luther had written
to Erasmus, of Rotterdam, who had
written in behalf of reformation in the
church, but that timid and irresolute
scholar made him no answer. Even
Spalatinus, once his ardent friend, was
now seized with fear. Eckius, who had
also been his friend, was, as we have
seen, in open opposition to him. At the
same time, society was violently torn
with the questions which Luther had
started. While some declared in his
favor, the majority, including a vast preponderance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
of the rich and powerful,
continued, even in Germany, to oppose
him. By the rigid Catholics he was
looked upon with horror. No terms too
harsh could be found to heap upon his
name; no scandal so vile could be invented,
that it did not find believers; he
was withal denounced by the papal bull
of excommunication, that formidable and
fearful curse, which few minds in that
age had the iron hardihood to withstand.
He was accused in the view of millions,
who would have deemed it a service
worthy of heaven to have taken the life
of one regarded as a disciple of the Devil.
The “arch-fiend” was a common title,
bestowed upon him by his enemies. Yet,
amid these perils, Luther stood as undaunted
as the oak before the tempest;
and though the lightning fell and the
thunder burst upon and around him, he
met it all unscathed.</p>

<p>Luther had, indeed, one powerful and
steadfast friend,—Frederick the Elector
of Saxony. The pope had endeavored
to persuade him to give up the dreaded
and hated priest, but in vain. He now
sought to accomplish his object by other
means. Maximilian, the Emperor of
Germany, was dead, and Charles V.,
King of Spain, in 1518, had been elected
in his place. Leo applied to him to
make an example of Luther, as an obdurate
heretic. Frederick interposed, and
persuaded Charles to cause him to be
tried by a diet of the empire at Worms.
Having obtained the emperor’s safe-conduct,
Luther set forward upon his journey
to that place, for his trial.</p>

<p>His friends trembled for the issue;
every heart seemed burthened save his
own. Melancthon, now his intimate
friend, attended him. Luther, in the pulpit,
seemed to breathe only of religion:
in society, he was frank, cheerful, and
engaging. He cultivated every innocent
thing that could make life more agreeable.
He went on his way to Worms,
which many expected would prove his
grave, with perfect equanimity, saying,
“If it is God’s will that I die, I am prepared;
yet I believe that my time has
not yet come.”</p>

<p>He arrived at Worms on the 16th of
April, 1521. On entering the town, he
began singing the hymn—“Our God is
a strong citadel”—and this became the
inspiring song of the Reformation. Numbers
of Luther’s friends, who were with
him, alarmed as they approached the city
of Worms, deserted him; but his cheerfulness
continued unchanged.</p>

<p>Worms was at that moment the point
to which the eyes of all Europe were
turned. Thither multitudes had gathered,
impelled by an intense desire to see
the result of the trial. The questions at
issue had evidently entered deeply into
the hearts of men; and now the person
who had caused this mighty movement
was there. And what was he? A simple
monk,—a man without station, office,
rank or badge; but truth and courage
had given him a power which made
potentates tremble. They were as the
Philistines, and he as Samson, with his
arms around the pillars of the temple.
With what a feeling of interest did the
concourse of people look on Martin
Luther that day!</p>

<p>He was conducted, the day after his
arrival, to the diet, by the marshal of the
empire. There were the cardinals and
princes in their badges of office and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
insignia of rank. It was an august
assembly, in which Charles V., Emperor
of Germany and King of Spain, presided.
Luther came in, wearing a simple black
gown, with a belt around his waist. He
moved with a modest but tranquil step.
Melancthon, Spalatinus and other friends
were at his side. Luther was now asked
if he acknowledged himself to be the
author of certain books bearing his name.
When they were enumerated, he said he
would not deny them. “Are you ready
to retract what has been condemned in
these books?” was now asked. He requested
time for reply;—a day was given
him. The enemies of Luther now triumphed,
and his friends feared for him.
It was apprehended that he would shrink
from the fearful ordeal. When he went
to the diet, he was cheered by thousands
of voices; as he returned, the enthusiasm
had passed away.</p>

<p>The next day, Luther again appeared
before the diet, and being asked if he
meant to retract his writings, he replied
mildly, yet firmly, in Latin, that he did
not. He besought the assembly to hear
with candor and judge him with fairness.
He appealed to the youthful emperor,
and mildly warned him against rash
judgments.</p>

<p>When one of the assembly demanded
of him a direct answer to the question
whether he would recant or not—he
replied that he would retract nothing,
unless it could be shown to be inconsistent
with the Bible. To the Scriptures
he appealed, as the word of God, and
when that sustained him, he would yield
nothing. “To act against my conscience,”
said he, “is neither safe nor
honest. Here I stand—I cannot do otherwise—may
God help me. Amen!”
The latter words were pronounced in his
native German, with a deep and affecting
emphasis.</p>

<p>Although the assembly, as Catholics,
disapproved of Luther’s views, his noble
bearing excited their respect and wonder.
The Archbishop of Treves, touched with
the sublimity of his conduct, paid him a
visit, and sought to win him back to the
church. This was, of course, in vain.
Luther’s friends were now filled with
enthusiastic admiration, and his enemies
could not withhold their respect. The
decision of the diet was of course against
him, and the emperor ordered him forthwith
to leave Worms. He left it on the
26th of April.</p>

<p>An edict was now issued by the emperor,
to go into effect as soon as his
safe-conduct to Luther should expire.
In this, he was denounced as the “Devil
in the shape of a man and the dress of a
monk. All the subjects of the empire,”
continued the bull, “are required to seize
upon him, and deliver him up to justice.”
It may well be believed that dismay now
seized upon the friends of Luther. What
was their horror, soon after, to hear that
as he was travelling with a single attendant
towards his house, he was beset in
the forests of Thuringia, dragged from
his carriage by several men in masks,
and hurried away. His companion had
escaped to tell the tale. Consternation
reigned throughout Germany, and in the
town of Wittemberg, sorrow and wailing
was in almost every dwelling.</p>

<p>But it was not long before a new work
from Luther’s pen was announced, and
it was of a date subsequent to his alleged
murder. Melancthon also received a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
letter from him—“Give yourself no uneasiness
for me,” said he; “both you
and your wife may rest assured of my
welfare. I am not only supplied with all
the necessaries of life, but if I chose I
could command the luxuries; but I trust
God will preserve me from such snares.
I wish not to receive the reward of my
labors in this world, but in the world to
come.”</p>

<p>The explanation of the mystery was
this. The elector, foreseeing that, in
consequence of the emperor’s proclamation,
Luther’s life would be in danger,
had caused him to be waylaid and carried
in safety to the old castle of Wartburg,
near Eisenach; while a story of
his murder was propagated by his fugitive
attendant. Luther, being supplied
with every convenience, devoted himself
to study, yet was required by the elector
by no means to permit his retreat to be
known. He was situated in an old castle,
built upon a lofty eminence which
commanded a delightful prospect. Freed
from care and anxiety, his mind seemed
to soar aloft like the birds around his
dwelling. His letters written at this
period are full of poetic fancy, and show
that his mind sympathized with the lovely
scenes around him.</p>

<p>His confinement lasted for ten months.
During this brief period, he translated
the New Testament into German, besides
writing treatises against auricular confession,
monastic vows, clerical celibacy,
prayers for the dead, &amp;c. His works
spread with amazing rapidity, and produced
a wonderful effect, particularly in
Saxony. Hundreds of monks quitted
their convents and married; the Austin
friars of Wittemberg abolished mass.
The excitement soon ran into excess, and
Carolstadt, a disciple of Luther, demolished
the images in a church at Wittemberg,
and proposed to banish all books
from the university, except the Bible.
He even affected to obey to the letter
the sentence pronounced on Adam, and
went to work a portion of each day in
the fields. The mild and polished Melancthon
caught the infection, and labored
in a baker’s shop.</p>

<p>Luther in his retirement heard of these
follies, which were calculated to ruin his
cause, and at the risk of his life immediately
departed for Wittemberg. He now
preached openly his doctrines, with amazing
power and effect. He succeeded in
quelling the violence of his fanatical followers.
These sermons are patterns of
moderation, wisdom and popular eloquence;
they show a marked contrast
to the violence and scurrility which soil
his writings directed against the malignity
and duplicity with which he had
chiefly to contend.</p>

<p>Luther was now the acknowledged
head of the reformation. He continued
by preaching and writing to aid the great
cause of Protestantism. His productions
were stained with coarse invective; but
this was the taste of the age, and belongs
equally to his opponents. In 1524, he
threw off his monastic dress, and condemned
monastic institutions. Convents
both of men and women were now rapidly
suppressed, and the reformation in
some cases ran into fanaticism. A sect
called Anabaptists ran into the wildest
extremes at Munster. They made war
upon property and law, and in their
madness practised the grossest vices and
crimes under the sanction of religion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Luther was sorely grieved at these
things, and did all in his power to correct
them, though not with complete
success.</p>

<p>In 1525, he married Catherine de
Bora, a young nun, who had left her
convent a year before, and resided with
Melancthon. He was happy in this marriage,
and though at the age of forty-two,
seems to have entered into it almost with
the affections of youth. In 1534, he completed
his great work, the German version
of the Bible, which is much admired
for its elegance, force and precision, and
has rendered the Scriptures really popular
in Germany.</p>

<p>The remaining years of his life were
passed in comparative quiet. In 1546,
being at Eisleben, he fell sick on the 17th
of February, and seemed at once to be
aware of his approaching end. He grew
worse in the evening, and died in the
midst of his friends, expressing a firm
conviction of the truth of that faith, which
he had taught. His body was carried
to Wittemberg, and buried with great
honors.</p>

<p>Luther’s works are voluminous, and
great favorites in Germany. In company,
he was always lively, and abounded in
sallies of wit and good humor; he gave
advice and assistance wherever it was
needed; he interested himself for every
indigent person who applied to him, and
devoted himself with his whole soul to
the pleasures of society. Rough and
stormy as are his controversial writings,
he was no stranger to the elegant arts.
His soul was filled with music, and he
often solaced himself by singing and
playing upon the flute and lute.</p>

<p>Nor is Luther to be regarded only in
the light of a religious reformer. He not
only burst the bonds of religious tyranny
throughout Christendom, but he created
in Germany that impulse towards spiritual
philosophy, that thirst for knowledge,
that logical exercise of the mind,
which have made the Germans the most
intellectual people in Europe. He was
the friend of education, of mental freedom,
of religious light, of civil liberty.
He rescued the Bible from the exclusive
grasp of the Church of Rome; by a gigantic
effort he translated it into his native
tongue; he not only made it acceptable
to forty millions who spoke his native
language, but he made it the common
property of the people of all Europe. He
was no courtly flatterer—but the friend
of the poor and the humble; he was as
ready to condemn cupidity and extravagance
among his followers, as among
those who adhered to the Church of
Rome.</p>

<p>The life which Luther led was calculated
to develop the sterner parts of his
character, and we must admit that his
writings display many gross and abusive
passages; yet he possessed many gentle
and attractive qualities. His love of music
amounted to a passion; “Old Hundred,”
a tune which has guided and
elevated the devotion of millions, was his
composition, and some of our sweetest
hymns were written by him. His familiar
letters are full of gentle affections.
Even when Tetzel, his special enemy,
was deserted by those who had used him,
and now, in poverty and desolation, was
upon his deathbed, Luther was at his
side, pouring into his harassed soul the
oil of consolation. One of his last acts,
was that of reconciliation, in a noble but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
distracted house. When we look through
the steel mail of the controversialist, the
reformer, and observe traits of character
like these, we cannot but lift our
thoughts with thanks to Heaven, that
human nature—with all its drawbacks—when
elevated by religion, has such
capacities as these.</p>

<p>To estimate Luther’s character, and
the work he accomplished, we must bear
in mind the circumstances under which
he acted. He was educated a Catholic,
in a country where the dominion of the
Romish Church was complete, as well
over the government as the people. All
around him, father, mother, friends, society
were living in abject submission to
the established creed. Doubts were held
as the suggestions of the Devil; freedom
of thought was infidelity; denial of any
received dogma was heresy, and worthy
the judgments of the Inquisitor—of punishment
here and hereafter. These were
the orthodox notions of the age, and
Luther was a priest of that church
which bound the civilized world to such
a system.</p>

<p>What a fearful struggle in his own
mind, with his own habits of thought,
his associations and convictions, did it
involve, for the Reformer first to doubt,
and then to repudiate, the faith which
thus enthralled him! What courage of
soul, to meet the fears that spring up in
the bosom; what energy of mind, to rend
asunder the chains that fetter the reason,
in such a condition! And when he had
triumphed over internal difficulties, what
a work was still before him! The pope,
by the invisible cords of spiritual despotism,
held all Europe in subjection.
Every monarch was more or less his
slave; every prison, like some fearful
monster, was ready to open its jaws at his
command, and close them upon whomsoever
he might designate: the jealous
inquisition, with all-seeing eyes, all-hearing
ears, spread its net on every
hand. All the united powers and prejudices
of society—public opinion, laws,
institutions, armies, prisons, chains, fire,
the rack—were in the hands of the
church, and it was against this that one
man was called to contend. It was as if
a single knight, and he without arms,
were called to attack the lordly castle,
whose massive walls and towering battlements
might look down with disdain
upon the assailant.</p>

<p>And yet Luther triumphed. We cannot
doubt that he was sustained by a
deep conviction of the rectitude of his
cause; that a sense of duty raised him
above the considerations of personal interest
and safety; that he acted as if in
the presence of God, and in the hope of
a heavenly, not an earthly, recompense.
We must not only admit that his abilities
were great; his qualities rare and well
adapted to his work; that he was a man
of peculiar singleness and sincerity of
aim; and that he was endowed with the
richest graces of religion; but we must
admit something more—that truth is
mighty; that the abuses of the Church
of Rome had risen to such a pitch as to
furnish the very elements of revolution;
and finally, that the good providence of
God shaped events to their great issues
in behalf of liberty and light. Can any
one explain the revolution achieved by
Luther, on any grounds short of these?</p>

<h3 class="h3head">English Farmers.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> picture represents a scene very
common in England, but more rare
with us. A farmer is paying the
rent of the house and farm he occupies,
to their owner. Here the farmer
usually owns the land he tills and the
house in which he dwells. It is not
always so, but land is so cheap with us,
that he may generally be the proprietor
of enough for the support of a family,
together with a tenement sufficient for
their comfort.</p>

<p>In England there is hardly such a
class of persons as our independent, prudent,
intelligent owners of the soil: the
farmers are there, for the most part, persons
of some wealth, who hire land upon
leases of twenty-one years. They are a
highly respectable class of persons, seldom
laboring themselves, and only overseeing
their numerous workmen. The
persons they employ are often exceedingly
poor, toiling very hard for small
wages, with poor fare.</p>

<p>The wife of the farmer in England is
generally a stout, rosy-cheeked, handsome
woman, very neatly dressed; she
oversees the dairy, and the various operations
of the household. She is generally
very systematic in her affairs; each
person has her particular course of duty,
and is expected to do it thoroughly.</p>

<p>The English farm-house is generally
of brick or stone; it is irregularly built,
and seems to have been put up at many
different times, according to circumstances
and without any regular plan. It
looks ancient, dark, respectable and comfortable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Within, it is a pattern of neatness,
and is full of good furniture. The
beds are plump, and the sheets white as
snow. Every bedroom is furnished with
a carpet, table, bureau, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The table of the English farmer is
generally well provided, and when the
family is seated around it, the scene is a
very pleasant one.</p>

 <p class="caption"><i>An English Farm-yard.</i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The barns in England are usually
of stone, and often several buildings are
crowded together. A good deal of the
hay is preserved in stacks. The barnyard
of a thriving English farmer is
generally a scene which seems to bespeak
wealth and abundance; but it must be
remembered that we are speaking of the
wealthier class. Some of these cultivate
several hundred acres, and it is not uncommon
for one farmer to pay an annual
rent of from five to ten thousand dollars.</p>

sold at 1400 dollars each; a panther is
worth 450 dollars, hyenas from 200 to

a fine ostrich is worth 900 dollars. A

<h3 class="h3head">A Story of the Revolution.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> following story, related by a mother
to her children, a few years
since, will show the spirit which existed
among the people of New England
at that trying period:</p>

<p>“Late in the afternoon of one of the
last days in May, ’76, when I was a few
months short of fifteen years old, notice
came to Townsend, Massachusetts, where
my father used to live, that fifteen soldiers
were wanted.</p>

<p>“The training band was instantly called
out, and my brother, next older than I,
was one that was selected. He did not
return till late at night, when all were
in bed. When I rose in the morning I
found my mother in tears, who informed
me that my brother John was to march
the day after to-morrow morning at sunrise.
My father was at Boston, in the
Massachusetts Assembly. Mother said
that though John was supplied with
summer clothes, he must be away seven
or eight months, and would suffer for
want of winter garments. There were
at this time no stores and no articles to
be had except such as each family would
make itself. The sight of mother’s tears
always brought all the hidden strength
of the body and mind to action. I immediately
asked what garment was needful.
She replied, ‘pantaloons.’</p>

<p>“‘O! if that is all,’ said I, ‘we will
spin and weave him a pair before he goes.’</p>

<p>“‘Tut,’ said my mother, ‘the wool is
on the sheep’s back, and the sheep are
in the pasture.’</p>

<p>“I immediately turned to a younger
brother, and bade him take a salt dish
and call them to the yard.</p>

<p>“Mother replied, ‘Poor child, there
are no sleep shears within three miles
and a half.’</p>

<p>“‘I have some small shears at the
loom,’ said I.</p>

<p>“‘But we can’t spin and weave it in
so short a time.’</p>

<p>“‘I am certain we can, mother.’</p>

<p>“‘How can you weave it?—there is a
long web of linen in the loom.’</p>

<p>“‘No matter; I can find an empty
loom.’ By this time the sound of the
sheep made me quicken my steps towards
the yard. I requested my sister
to bring me the wheel and cards, while
I went for the wool. I went into the
yard with my brother, and secured a
white sheep, from which I sheared, with
my loom shears, half enough for a web;
we then let her go with the rest of the
fleece. I sent the wool in with my sister.
Luther ran for a black sheep, and
held her while I cut off wool for my filling
and half the warp, and then we allowed
her to go with the remaining part
of her fleece.</p>

<p>“The wool thus obtained was duly
carded and spun, washed, sized, and
dried; a loom was found a few doors off,
the web got in, woven, and prepared, cut
and made two or three hours before my
brother’s departure—that is to say, in forty
hours from the commencement, without
help from any modern improvement.”</p>

<p>The good old lady closed by saying,
“I felt no weariness, I wept not, I was
serving my country. I was assisting
poor mother, I was preparing a garment
for my darling brother.</p>

<p>“The garment being finished, I retired
and wept, till my overcharged and
bursting heart was relieved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>This brother was, perhaps, one of
Gen. Stark’s soldiers, and with such a
spirit to cope with, need we wonder that
Burgoyne did not execute his threat of
marching through the heart of America?</p>

<h3 class="h3head">
Lady Jane Grey.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">e</span> think our readers can hardly fail
to be interested in the story of this
amiable, but unfortunate lady. We
shall therefore tell it at some length.</p>

<p>Melancholy as was the fate of this
illustrious personage, she was fortunate,
in one respect. Though placed in a situation
to excite envy and prejudice, and
though calumny and misrepresentation
might be deemed a road to royal favor,
no one of her cotemporaries has dared to
say ought that was ill of her; and the
more attentive is the examination of her
history and character, the more deserving
will she be found of those praises,
which some, in later times, have hinted
to have had their origin in a desire to
glorify a political and religious martyr.</p>

<p>She was the daughter of Henry Grey,
Duke of Suffolk, and Frances Brandon,
a granddaughter of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, and was
born at “a very faire, large, and beautiful
house,” called Bradgate, in 1537.</p>

<p>The intercourse between parents and
children was not of that pleasing character,
now so universal; good discipline
was maintained by fear, rather than
love; children, especially daughters,
were never admitted to any familiarity
with their parents; they were obliged,
even in womanhood, to stand at the cupboard
side during visits, except when
permitted to have a cushion to kneel on;
and it was not unusual for ladies of the
highest rank, to correct their grown-up
daughters, even before company, with
the large fans which it was the fashion
to carry.</p>

<p>The parents of Lady Jane were even
more than usually severe; which with
one, who from her birth was distinguished
for the gentleness of her disposition,
was wholly unnecessary; “for what
need,” says the quaint Fuller, “of iron
instruments to bow wax?” The first
care of her parents would doubtless be
to instruct her in those matters which
were deemed indispensable to a young
lady’s education. She was taught music,
and not only played on several musical
instruments, but accompanied them
with a voice exquisitely sweet; her execution
in needle-work was beautiful;
she was skilled in the art of making
confectionary, then an important part of
lady-like duty; nor was she deficient in
a knowledge of surgery and medicine,
for the practice of which arts those boisterous
times furnished frequent occasion.
At a period a little earlier than
this, with a knowledge of these things,
a young lady’s education would have
been deemed complete; for reading and
writing were thought to be dangerous
accomplishments, any further than to be
able to spell out the Missal. But the
reformation in religion had excited a desire
for general knowledge, as well as a
spirit of inquiry into religious matters;
learning, as well with women as with
men, became the fashion; “a grete number
of noble women,” we are told by a
contemporary writer, “were given to the
studie of human sciences, and of strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
tongues, and it was a common thinge to
see young virgins so nouzled and trained
in the study of letters, that they willingly
set all other vain pastymes at naught
for learnynge’s sake.”</p>

<p>The early promise which lady Jane
gave of genius and excellence, induced
her parents to bestow even more than
ordinary pains in the cultivation of her
intellect. The most learned men of the
day were chosen to be her preceptors,
and under their instruction, she, at a
very early age, became well skilled in
the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaic,
Arabic, French, and Italian languages,
as well as in her own tongue.</p>

<p>The severity of her parents proved of
ultimate benefit to Lady Jane, in a manner
which she shall herself relate. The
celebrated scholar, Roger Ascham, being
about to leave England on a diplomatic
mission to Germany, went to take leave
of the family at Bradgate, who had been
his early patrons. He tells us that on
his arrival there, he found that the duke
and duchess, with all the ladies and gentlemen
of their household, were hunting
in the park; but that the Lady Jane was
in her chamber. Requesting permission
to pay his respects to her, to whom he
states himself to have been much beholden,
he was admitted. He found her
reading the Phædon of Plato, in Greek,
with as much delight as some gentlemen
of that day would have read a merry tale
of Boccacio. Having made every respectful
inquiry, according to the custom
of the times, he asked the youthful student
why she would lose such pastime,
as was going on in the park? She replied,
“I wisse all their sport in the park
is but a shadow to that pleasure I find in
Plato. Alas, good folk! they never felt
what true pleasure means.” Ascham
then asked, “How came you, madam,
to this deep knowledge of pleasure? and
what did chiefly allure you unto it, seeing
not many women, but very few men
have attained thereunto?” “I will tell
you,” replied Lady Jane, “and tell you a
truth, which, perchance, you will marvel
at. One of the greatest benefits that
ever God gave me, is, that he sent me so
sharp and severe parents, and so gentle
a schoolmaster; for, when I am in presence
either of father or mother, whether
I speak, keep silence, sit, stand or go,
eat, drink, be merry, or sad, be sewing,
playing, dancing, or doing anything else,
I must do it, as it were, even so perfectly
as God made the world, or else I am
sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened,
yea, presently sometimes with pinches,
nibs and bobs, and other ways, (which I
will not name, for the honor I bear
them,) so without measure disordered,
that I long for the time that I must go to
Mr. Aylmer, who teacheth me so gently,
so pleasantly, with such fair allurements
to learning, that I think all the time nothing
whiles I am with him; and when
I am called from him, I fall on weeping,
because whatsoever I do else but learning,
is full of great trouble, fear, and whole
misliking to me; and thus my book
bringeth daily to me more pleasure and
more.” This interview made a lasting
impression on Ascham, and we find him
referring to it in a letter which he addressed
to her from Germany. “I have
travelled far; I have visited the greatest
cities, and have made the most diligent
observations upon the manners of nations,
their institutions, laws, religion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and regulations; but I have found nothing
that has raised in me greater admiration
than what I found in regard to
yourself last summer; to see one so
young and lovely, in the noble hall of
her family, at the very moment when all
her friends were enjoying the field-sports;
to find, I repeat, so divine a maid
diligently perusing the divine Phædon
of Plato; in this more happy, it may be
believed, than in her noble and royal
lineage.”</p>

<p>In addition to her own personal claims,
there existed on the part of the reformed
clergy a new source of interest. Rumor
said that she was the destined wife of
the young monarch, Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, and as
such they looked upon her as the future
supporter of the true interests of Christianity.
Perhaps, had the youthful parties
been allowed to follow their own inclination,
the union might have taken
place; they were playmates in their infancy,
and there was a great sympathy
of tastes, as well as similarity of temper.
But the choice of each must be controlled
and made subservient to the purposes of
ambition. Before Lady Jane was eleven
years old, the possession of her hand in
marriage became the object of political
intrigue. Somerset, the Protector, sought
it for his son, hoping, also, to bring
about the marriage of the young king
with his own daughter. But these
schemes, by which he trusted to secure
the permanence of his power, proved the
cause of his downfall. His brother, Lord
Sudley, was equally ambitious, and
more artful; and finding that Somerset’s
plans could not otherwise be counteracted,
he became the chief agent in procuring
his death. Sudley’s triumph was
short; he himself fell before more successful
rivals, Northumberland and Suffolk,
who soon attained to a degree of
power, which left nothing to be desired
but to give it permanency.</p>

<p>The health of the king was manifestly
failing, and his death would be their destruction;
for zealous protestants such as
they, had nothing to hope from a Roman
Catholic sovereign. The order of succession
then, as limited by Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>,
must be changed. This was a bold
measure, but it might be successful;
Mary and Elizabeth had both been declared
illegitimate by act of parliament,
at Henry’s own suggestion; it was but
to procure a confirmation of this, and
Lady Jane Grey stood next to the throne.</p>

<p>To cement the union between these
ambitious nobles, a marriage was arranged
between the Lady Jane and Lord
Guilford Dudley, son of the Duke of
Northumberland. There was short time
for courtship, and the practice of those
acts of gallantry which the fashion of
the day required. No sweet madrigal
softened the way to the lady’s heart;
nor had the appointed bridegroom much
time for the display, on his breast or in
his hat, of the little gold-embroidered
and edged handkerchief, with the tassels
at each corner and in the middle, which
enamored damsels were wont to present
to their favorites. The marriage followed
close upon the agreement; the
king, to show the pleasure which it gave
him, was bountiful in his gifts. But
even in this his natural love of economy
was gratified; for the forfeiture of the
effects of the duke and duchess of Somerset
had placed at his disposal much
rich apparel, not much the worse for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
wear, which he now bestowed on the
bridal party.</p>

<p>Though the match was one of ambition
on the part of the parents, it was
well calculated to secure the happiness
of the parties, for the Lord Guilford Dudley
would seem to have possessed every
quality fitted to win a lady’s heart, and
to keep it. Besides the approval of the
king, it met with that of the court and
of the public, who, as the bridal procession
passed along, were loud in testifying
their admiration of the beauty and
innocence of the youthful bridegroom
and his lovely bride.</p>

<p>The pomp and splendor which attended
these nuptials, formed the last beam
of joy that shone in the palace of Edward,
who grew so weak a few days afterwards,
that Northumberland thought
it time to carry his project into execution.
How he effected his purpose cannot
be better stated than in the language
of Fuller. “King Edward, tender in
years and weak with sickness, was so
practised upon by the importunity of others,
that, excluding his two sisters, he conveyed
the crown to the Ladie Jane, his
kinswoman, by that which we may well
call the <em>testament</em> of King Edward, and
the <em>will</em> of the Duke of Northumberland.
Thus, through the pious intents of this
prince, wishing well to the Reformation;
the religion of Mary obnoxious to exception;
the ambition of Northumberland,
who would do what he listed; the simplicity
of Suffolk, who would be done
with as the other pleased; the dutifulness
of the Lady Jane, disposed by her
parents; the fearfulness of the judges,
not daring to oppose; and the flattery
of courtiers most willing to comply, matters
were made as sure, as man’s policy
can make that good which is bad in
itself.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Bamboo.</span>—This is an eastern
production, of various and most important
uses. It grows from fifteen to sixty
feet high, being from five to fifteen inches
in diameter. It grows as much as twenty
feet in a few weeks. It flourishes
wild in many places, but it is cultivated
with great care in China and other
places. The soft shoots are cut and
eaten like asparagus, and sometimes
salted and eaten with rice. The hollow
joints afford a liquid, and if not drawn
off, a concrete, medical substance. Its
seeds are eaten as a delicacy; its large
joints are used as buckets; and, in many
countries, no other wood is used for
building. Ships are framed out of it,
and it furnishes masts and yards. Its
leaves make fans. It is also used to
make bows, and to convey water to a
distance. It also forms writing-pens,
and is woven into baskets, cages, hats,

paper, and is also used for many kinds
of furniture.</p>

a mirror, was directed to the bottom,
which rendered the knife visible, and a
magnet, fastened to a pole, brought it up
again.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thanks</span>, gentle friends, for your many favors—but
you must not expect me to insert them
all here. I read them with great satisfaction,
and even when you find a little fault, I am not
the less pleased—particularly if you tell me
how to do better. But as to printing all your
epistles, you must consider that I have Bill
Keeler’s stories to put in, and the Old Man’s in
the Corner, and a great many other things. I
have, indeed, so many matters crowding into
my columns, that I am this month obliged to
leave out Dick Boldhero altogether! However,
I find that our subscribers like Our Correspondence
very well, and therefore I shall put in as
much of it as my space will allow.</p>

<p class="quotesig">
<i>Syracuse, July 7, 1844.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Merry</span>,—I hope you will be willing to
have a letter from me, as I am going to tell
about the salt works of this place.</p>

<p>Syracuse is a large town, with about 8000
inhabitants. A mile from us, is Salina, a village
in which are many salt springs. The
water is pumped out and conducted by canals
to Syracuse, where salt is made from it. The
water is stronger than sea water, and yields a
great deal more salt.</p>

<p>The salt is made by vats, which expose the
water to the sun and evaporate it, or by boiling
it. Both methods are adopted. There are a
great many of these establishments, and it is
supposed that this year they will all make four
millions of bushels.</p>

<p>One establishment puts up 1200 bags of 28
pounds each, a day. They require about 1200
yards of cotton cloth, every day, for the bags.
You would be very much interested to go into
this establishment. There is a long flue, more
than seventy feet long, which runs under a
great many kettles, in which the water is constantly
boiling. The salt is here formed in
crystals, white as snow. It is taken out and
put in a bin, where it looks like a great long
snow-drift.</p>

<p>It is taken from this place, and put in a trough
thirty feet long and ten wide, with fire beneath;
a sort of harrow is made to work back and forward
in this, thus stirring the salt. It is then
ground, and carried by machinery to a place
where it is put in bags.</p>

<p>It is really a curious place, and if you were
there, you would think salt as plenty as snow
in winter at Boston.</p>

<p>The salt made at Syracuse is very much
liked; some of it is fine and nice for the table.
Some is put up in small, neat boxes and sent
all over the country.</p>

<p>When you were here the other day, I got a
peep at a man they told me was you; but as
he hadn’t a wooden leg, I have some doubts
whether it was really you. Perhaps your leg
has grown on again, or you have had one put
in as good as new—for it is said the Yankees,
down east, are very clever at domestic manufactures.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Merry, if you don’t put this into
your Magazine, I hope you will at least say
that you have received it. I like the Magazine
pretty well, but I didn’t understand what that
picture of the big, jumping bull meant at the
beginning of the April number. Perhaps you
can tell me.&emsp;&emsp;Yours,</p>
<p class="p0 quotesig"><span class="smcap">J——s L——n</span>.</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p class="p2"><span class="muchlarger">☞</span> We are obliged to confess that our friend
here has given us a good hint; the animal he
mentions was meant for <span class="dfn">Taurus</span>, the Bull,
which is the zodiacal sign for April.</p>

times, when it should come, but I am obliged to
go away without it. You know “hope deferred
makes the heart sick.” So I am often disappointed.
Will you do better in this, good Mr.

<p class="drop-cap">S<span class="smcap">eptember</span> has come, and it would
seem by the picture, that peaches
have come with it. This is indeed a
fine season for our little friends who
are fond of fruit, such as peaches, pears,
and plums. Who is there, indeed, that
does not like these nice things? But
beware, boys and girls; do not indulge
in them to excess. Even the best things
in this world may be converted into evils
by abuse. Even peaches, which are not
only delicious but very wholesome, may
still become the occasion of disease, if
taken in undue quantities.</p>

<p>Thus you see that moderation is
required of us in the midst of our enjoyments.
But I do not intend now to
preach a sermon. It is September, one
of the pleasantest months of the year,
and I have a few pleasant words to say
about it. It is a season of delicious
fruits; it is also a period when the excessive
heat of summer is succeeded by the
mild and gentle coolness of approaching
autumn. The landscape has lost something
of its brilliant verdure. The fields
and forests are tinged with a sober
brown. The leaves of the maple, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
ash, and the oak are exchanging their
green hue for brilliant dyes of red, purple,
and yellow. Many of the birds are
gathering in flocks, and, with much noisy
chattering, are preparing to depart to
southern climes, where they may spend
the winter. The sparrow, the cat-bird,
the thrush, and the towee-bunting have
already withdrawn into the thickets.
The robin has left the orchard, and retired
to the forests, and the young crows,
trying to caw like their fathers and mothers,
are heard in the mountains.</p>

<p>Whoever will take a walk in the
woods will see a great many of that
splendid bird, which has so many names,
glancing from tree to tree, and seeming
to hold some very good-natured discourse
with his companions. This is the high-hole,
high pole, flecker, yellow jay, or
golden-winged wood-pecker, whichever
you choose to call him.</p>

<p>The gardener is now rooting up the
weeds, and the farmer is getting in his
second crop of hay, called <span class="dfn">rowen</span>. The
markets are now full of melons, and
other fruits and vegetables, of many
kinds,—potatoes, beets, carrots, cabbages,
and tomatoes. Surely, September is a
fine time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">All Hallow-e’en.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">mong</span> the inhabitants of Scotland, the
last day of October is called All
Hallow-e’en, or Holy evening. The
people formerly had many superstitions
and some pleasant customs respecting
it. These still linger in the Highlands;
and the following story, extracted
from an English book, will give some
account of the manner in which this
evening is still commemorated there.</p>

<p>There are few Highlanders in whom
the memory of Hallow-e’en does not
awaken some pleasing recollections of the
past, and with it are associated some of
their happiest days. I propose to explain
to my young friends some of the joyous
festivities of this season.</p>

<p>Among many families in the Highlands,
there were none I loved so well
as the Graemes of Glennburton. Four
merry girls and one quiet boy circled
their hearth on the last day of October,
the eventful Hallow-e’en. A crowd of
young visitors was also there. The
cheerful dance over, our dear and kind
friend, Mr. Graeme, drank to many happy
Hallow-e’ens, in which we noisy youngsters
joined most heartily.</p>

<p>The nut basket now appeared. Nell
Graeme, the second daughter, a tall girl
of seventeen, singled out two nuts and
said, “Who shall I burn?” At once,
the whole group, who were quite prepared,
cried, “Geraldine and Lord Elva.”
The two nuts were placed in one bright
spot in the fire; they burnt for a time
most lovingly; but at last Geraldine
bounded out of the fire. Oh! naughty
girl—she had fairly quarrelled with him
whom her young companions had declared
to be her sweetheart.</p>

<p>Geraldine now sprang forward, and
revenged herself by burning the blushing
Nell with her coz. It was very
amusing to watch the countenance of
each damsel, as her name was given to
the nut, and coupled with another. One
girl blushed, a second laughed, a third
cast down her eyes, and so on. Tired
of this, they at length hurried to tea; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
then came the real fun, as that noisy,
pretty black-eyed girl, Jessie Graeme,
declared.</p>

<p>Now, my young friends, follow me to
Mrs. Graeme’s kitchen; yes, to the
kitchen,—clean, bright, and pure enough
for any one to enter; the floor well
scoured and sprinkled with sand; the
small copper saucepans and tin covers
hung round the walls, shining and bright
as burnished gold; the mutton-hams and
other delicacies in such famous order
hanging overhead. It was the abode
of plenty and cleanliness; so I thought,
as I entered it, and surveyed with delight
the preparations for the “company,” as
Mary the cook said.</p>

<p>A huge tub full of crystal water was
in the middle of the floor, and a basket
of immense rosy-cheeked apples. The
company entered. Plump went three
dozen apples into the tub, with a splashing
that made the ladies retreat speedily.
Mr. Graeme put numerous shillings and
sixpences into the apples, and we all
ducked to fish them out. Happy those
who got an apple; thrice happy those
who got money in their apples. Many
untoward accidents occurred; Jane had
fastened her long curls with a comb, and
as she stooped and hunted down a rolling
apple, Jessie Graeme, lover of mischief
and fun, pulled out the comb;
down went the ringlets, to assist poor
Jane in her search after the apple.</p>

<p>Jessie laughed heartily, and in her
turn danced up to the tub. No sooner
had she bent over the water, than Hugh
slily pushed her in, and the ill-fated Jessie
fell plump into the water. Her
brother helped her out, and though
strongly tempted to cuff his cheeks for
his impudence, she was obliged to march
off and change her wet clothing. Tired
at length of this diversion, “snap dragon”
was called. “Hurrah for snap dragon!”
cried Harriet Graeme.</p>

<p>A large flat dish, filled with whisky
and raisins, cleared from their stalks,
was laid upon the table; gloves and mittens
were hastily torn off; pocket handkerchiefs,
scarfs, and other combustible
parts of the ladies’ dresses were put out
of the way. There was a rush and a
crowd round the dish; Hugh held the
match to the spirits, and the blue flame
flickered, and the “mountain dew”
blazed gloriously. “Begin!” shouted
Hugh.</p>

<p>Fifty hands were at once dipped into
the snap dragon, and drawn back, carrying
streams of the blue and liquid flame.
Another plunge! fresh screams, and a
river of fire on the table; the dish upset;
Harriet’s dress on fire; Donald the gardener’s
hair in a blaze. A hearth-rug
nearly smothered Harriet, and a bucket
of water cooled Donald completely.
There was a universal burst of laughter;
even Black Kitty, the cook maid, so
called, from her jet black hair, was heard
to giggle behind the scullery door; and
Donald, now recovered from his singeing
and ducking, roared himself into convulsions
in the back passage. They now
all began to count the raisins; whoever
had the largest odd number was the
lucky one. Merry Jessie was the lucky
one.</p>

<p>The happy party now retired to the
drawing-room, saying, that of all games,
snap dragon was the most amusing.
Up stairs, they found a blazing fire, and
supper laid on the table. In the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
of it stood, most conspicuously, the Hallow-e’en
cake, so delicately iced over
and ornamented with a wreath and
bunch of the last roses. This cake contained
a ring, for marriage; a sixpence
for wealth; and a thimble, for an old
maid. The cake was cut up by Hugh.
The youngest of the party took the first
piece, and the gentle fairy, Minna Erskine,
found the ring. Jessie Graeme
darted forward, and seizing a bit of cake,
crumbled it to atoms, and found the sixpence.
Happy little pair, who, almost
screaming with joy, fairly hugged each
other with delight.</p>

<p>Dear mamma was declared a confirmed
old maid by finding the thimble.
The laughter of the young ones at this
knew no bounds; but they were soon
brought to order by Mr. Graeme, reminding
them that it was within a quarter of
an hour of midnight, and that “good
nights” must be exchanged. The young
ones quickly though reluctantly took the
hint, and after affectionate kissings and
greetings, from our papas and mammas,
we all marched off, once more to talk of
the events of the evening, and to anticipate
and prepare for fresh sports and
merriment.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">Bonaparte’s Wit.</span>—Soon after Napoleon
had attained the rank of captain,
a soldier one day approached him, and
showed him his coat which was in rags,
at the same time demanding another in
a dissatisfied tone. “A new coat?” replied
the young officer; “you do not call
to mind that your honorable scars would
no longer be visible.” This well-timed
compliment entirely satisfied the poor
soldier.</p>

<p>After Napoleon became emperor, during
a parade, a young officer stepped out
of the ranks, in extreme agitation, to complain
that he had been ill-used, slighted,
and passed over, and that he had been
five years a lieutenant, without being
able to obtain promotion. “Calm yourself,”
said the emperor; “I was seven
years a lieutenant, and yet you see that
a man may push himself forward for all
that.” Everybody laughed, and the
young officer, suddenly cooled by these
words, returned to his place.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following description of the gardens
at the Tusculan villa, Belvidere, in
Italy, is given by a traveller. “Behind
the palace,” says he, “an aquatic stream
dashes precipitately down a succession
of terraces, and is tormented below, into
a variety of tricks. The whole court
seems alive at the turning of the cock.
Water attacks you on every side; it is
squirted in your face from invisible
holes; it darts up in a constellation of
<i lang="fr">jets d’eau</i>; it returns in misty showers,
which present against the sun a beautiful
iris. Water is made to blow the
trumpet of a centaur and the pipe of a
cyclops; water plays two organs; makes
the birds warble and the muses tune their
reeds; it sets Pegasus neighing, and all
Parnassus on music. I mention this
magnificent touch as a specimen of Italian
hydraulics. Its sole object is to surprise
strangers.”</p>

</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> a preceding number we have given
an account of the manner in which
Katrina was taken from her mother
and borne away into the woods. We
must now continue the story, as it was
related by Bill to his companions.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the state of excitement
produced upon M. Hielder by
the news of the carrying off of his daughter;
for a few moments, he seemed to be
in a frenzy of rage, muttered the name
of Hieldover between his teeth, clenched
his fist, and uttered the most terrific imprecations.
But in a short time, he conquered
his passion, and, ordering six
men to attend him, they all set out in
pursuit of the offender. They had
learned as well as they could from Madam
Hielder the direction which the robber
had taken, which appeared to be
towards the mountains. They soon
found the traces of footsteps which led
along the bank of a small river that
swept down from the heights. They
followed these for about two miles, when
the ground became rocky and broken,
and they could no longer trace them. It
seemed certain, however, that the stranger
had ascended the mountain, directing
his course to a deep and wild dell
that lay between two rugged cliffs, that
seemed to rear their naked heads to the
clouds.</p>

<p>The party drew themselves out in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
lengthened line, and proceeded to search
the tangled valley that lay before them.
The impatience of Hielder led him in
front of the pursuers, and the excited
state of his feelings made him almost
forget his attendants. It was not long
before he saw, or thought he saw, the
object of his pursuit. He rushed forward,
urging his way between the
branches of the trees and the thick mass
of underwood, regardless of the obstacles
that lay in his path, his garments torn,
and his hair streaming in the wind. He
was soon separated from his companions,
and entirely forgetting them, urged
his way through the wilderness.</p>

<p>Again he fancied that he saw the figure
of a man, at a considerable distance,
bearing a child in his arms. He seemed
to be straining up the sides of the mountains,
and at a considerable distance.
Hielder redoubled his efforts, and in his
agony of mind, shouted aloud, filling the
hollow of the mountain with his cries.
For a long time he continued his pursuit,
occasionally catching glimpses of
the flying robber and his daughter, or objects
that seemed to be such. At length
he came to an open space, and on a rocky
eminence before him, he imagined that
he saw the form of Hieldover, holding
out his child in triumphant mockery.
Hielder was armed with pistols, and,
snatching one of these from his belt, he
aimed it at the form of Hieldover, and
fired. This was instantly followed by a
scream, which seemed to be that of the
child. Smitten with horror at the idea
that he had killed his daughter, the father
sank down on the ground in a state
of insensibility.</p>

<p>It was now evening, and M. Hielder,
as we have stated, had been for a considerable
time separated from his attendants.
They had discovered his absence
from their line, and for some hours had
been in search of him. One of them
heard the report of the pistol, and directed
his steps towards the spot from which
the sound seemed to proceed. In the
darkness, however, he passed the body
of his master, and continued to push forward.
The pursuit was continued till
morning, when the party collected together
by means of signals, and began
to deliberate upon what was to be done.</p>

<p>While they were thus occupied, they
saw M. Hielder approaching. They
were all struck with amazement at his
strange appearance. His clothes were
torn in fragments; his hat was gone, and
there were traces of blood upon his face.
His countenance was pale as ashes, and
his eye had the startled and wild expression
which belongs to a madman. He
said not a word, and when the men addressed
him he gave no answer. After
a little deliberation, they concluded to
return, and two of them, taking their
master by the arms, led him homeward.
He made no resistance, and, in the course
of a few hours, they reached the house.</p>

<p>M. Hielder continued in a state of
derangement for nearly two weeks. He
was not violent, but his mind seemed constantly
occupied with the vision of some
object before him, which he earnestly
sought to reach. Sometimes in his eagerness,
he would spring out of his bed, and
endeavor to pursue the phantom, which
fled before him and eluded his grasp.
At others, he would beckon to it, and
again reach out his arms, beseeching it
to come to him. He often uttered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
name of Hieldover, and would frequently
say, “Give me back my child; give
me my daughter, and I will restore all.
Be satisfied, Hieldover, with your revenge.
Take the money, but give me
my child. Is there such cruelty in the
heart of man? will you wring the heart
that is broken? will you grind in the
dust the form that crouches at your foot?
Do as you please—kill me, if you will,
but restore to me once more my child.”</p>

<p>The wife of the poor man was unceasing
in her attentions. Day and night
she was at his bedside, seeking to allay
the fever of his mind, and administering
to him such medicines as the physician
prescribed. Nor were these kind and
skilful ministrations without their due
effect. By degrees the symptoms of the
patient became alleviated, and, in the
space of a few weeks, his reason seemed
to be restored. Yet his form was wasted
almost to a shadow, and his mind seemed
to participate in the exhausted condition
of his body. He however gradually
rose from this state of depression, and at
last seemed once more in the possession
of health and vigor.</p>

<p>His countenance, however, was greatly
changed. The stern, dark, moody
expression which formerly brooded over
his countenance, had given place to settled
melancholy, tinged with a somewhat
startled aspect. His firm nerves,
too, had become shaken, and the sudden
rustling of the wind, or the sound of an
unwonted footstep, made him tremble
from head to foot. There was still a
haughty feeling in him, which taught
him to conquer these humiliating symptoms;
but in the struggle between pride
and weakness, an effort often took place,
which was manifested by the large cold
drops standing upon his forehead.</p>

<p>The early history of M. Hielder was
unknown to the people around him.
They were ignorant of the visit paid
him by the stranger, who called himself
Hieldover, and which we have already
described. They were at a loss, therefore,
to account for the events which had
recently transpired. Who could have
carried off the child? What motive
could any one have for such an act?
Why was the master of the house
wrought up into such a frenzy? Why
was he cheated with illusions, and finally
driven to a state of madness in the
mountains? These were the questions
discussed by the gossips around the
house; and as no better answer to these
inquiries could be found, they were all
resolved by the conclusion that the dark
and mysterious being who carried off the
girl, was the devil himself.</p>

<p>I am sorry to have anything to say
about this personage; but a century ago,
when these things happened, it was very
much the fashion to lay everything to
him which could not be otherwise explained.
Of course, whoever undertakes
to tell a story of that day, is likely to
have something to say about him. We
need only add, that we shall have as little
as possible to do with him on this, as
on every other occasion.</p>

<p>The suggestion having been once
made that the scenes we have described
were the work of a being of the other
world, it soon grew into the established
opinion of the people attached to Hielder
house. Nor were confirmations of
this wanting. Several of the servants
declared that they had seen, in the evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
twilight, a dark figure, with a slouched
hat and wrapped in a cloak, moving mysteriously
along the avenues around the
house. Others insisted that they had
seen a strange light dancing in the hollow
of the mountain, where M. Hielder
had met the strange apparition.</p>

<p>These tales soon reached the ears of
their master, and he readily concluded
that they might be founded in truth.
He determined, therefore, to investigate
the subject for himself. In the course
of a few evenings, he saw a dusky figure
standing in the shadow of the trees at no
great distance from the house. He approached
it, but it glided from him, and
was soon lost in the depths of the forest.
He, however, pursued the retreating
spectre. He soon saw it again, and it
seemed now to pause. He approached
it, and could distinctly recognize the tall
and majestic figure of Hieldover. At
this moment, the latter spoke—“Approach
me not, as you value your life;
but if you wish to know the fate of your
child, visit me to-morrow at this hour.
You will find me at home in the mountains.”
Saying this, the form departed,
and was immediately buried in the mazes
of the wood.</p>

<p>M. Hielder was thrilled with a kind
of horror, but he determined to accept the
fearful invitation. At the appointed time,
he left the house alone, and set out for
the mountains. It was now autumn,
and the leaves were beginning to fall
from the trees. The night was gloomy,
and the wind swept in hollow gusts
through the forest. The tops of the
trees waved with an uneasy and troubled
motion in the gale. There was no human
voice to disturb the night, but many
strange and ominous sounds came upon
the ear of the adventurer, as he now began
to ascend the shaggy sides of the
highlands. The creaking of the trees,
whose branches rubbed against each
other, the shrill wailing of the owl, and
the continued roar of the wind, served to
increase his excitement, though not in
any degree to shake his purpose.</p>

<p>Resolutely striding on through the
mass of crumpled leaves that covered
the ground, he reached, at last, a position
that commanded a view of the spot
where he had seen his child in the arms
of Hieldover. This consisted of a mound
of rocks, which rose in the form of a
pyramid in the centre of a valley, scooped
out of the side of a mountain. The
whole scene was covered with trees, except
a small space which encircled the
mound. This consisted of a grassy belt,
through which a small stream passed on
either side of the pyramidal rock.</p>

<p>M. Hielder paused a moment to consider
what course he should take, when
a small flame gleamed upward from the
very point where Hieldover was standing
with his child, when he discharged the
pistol, as we have related. Receiving
this as a signal, he plunged down into
the valley, crossed the stream, and, with
an almost frenzied energy, began to
climb the rocky mound. Seizing upon
the branches of trees and shrubs, he
clambered upward, and soon attained
the point from which the light was still
gleaming.</p>

 alt="John Howard">

<h3 class="h3head">John Howard.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> eminent and laborious philanthropist
was born in 1727. His father
was a London tradesman, who, dying
early, left him in possession of a
handsome fortune. Having always been
fond of travelling, he conceived a desire
to visit Lisbon immediately after the
great earthquake. He embarked accordingly,
but was captured by a French
privateer. To this accident the world is
probably indebted for the exertions made
afterwards by Howard for the relief of
prisoners. The sufferings which he endured
himself and witnessed in his
fellow-captives, made an ineffaceable impression
upon his mind.</p>

<p>This was strengthened by his being
made sheriff of Bedfordshire, when he
had charge of all the prisons in the
county. Shocked by the miseries and
abuses which he found prevailing in
these abodes of crime and misfortune,
he set himself diligently to work to inquire
into the nature of the evil, and, if
possible, to find a remedy. During the
year 1773, he visited most of the county<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
gaols in England, and having obtained
information on their management, he
laid the result of his inquiries before the
House of Commons. In 1774, two acts
were passed; one for relieving acquitted
prisoners from the payment of fees; the
other for preserving the health of the
prisoners.</p>

<p>Howard being once actively engaged,
became more and more devoted to his
benevolent pursuits. He travelled repeatedly
over Great Britain, sometimes
even extending his journeys to the continent,
visiting the most noisome places,
and relieving the wants of the most
wretched objects. In 1777, he published
a quarto volume containing details of
prisons in various places, and containing
a mass of information really astonishing,
when we consider that it was obtained
at the constant hazard of his life from
infection, and by untiring and unassisted
labor.</p>

<p>The importance, both in prisons and
hospitals, of preventing the spreading
of infectious diseases, produced in Mr.
Howard the desire to witness the success
of the Lazaretto system in the south of
Europe, more especially as a safeguard
against the plague. Danger or disgust
never turned him from his path, and on
this occasion he went without a servant,
not thinking it right, for convenience’
sake, to expose another person to such a
risk.</p>

<p>In 1785, he travelled through France,
Italy, and thence to Smyrna, where the
plague was raging, in order that he might
undergo the quarantine at Venice, to
which place he sailed. In 1787, this
devoted man returned home and published
the result of his foreign travels.
Two years after, he renewed his travels
on the continent, intending to go to
Turkey. He had, however, proceeded
no further than the Crimea, when a rapid
illness, which he believed to be an infectious
fever, caught in prescribing for a
lady, put an end to his life, January 20th,
1790. He was buried at Cherson, and
the utmost respect was paid to his memory
by the Russian government.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard’s character was pure and
simple; without great talents, but accomplishing
much by devoting his whole
energies to one good object. He was
abstemious in his habits, and capable of
going through great fatigue, spending
freely both his fortune and constitution
in the cause to which his life was devoted.
He was twice married, and lived
at Cardington, near Bedford. He had one
son, who unfortunately became insane.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">Lovewell’s War.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> are few passages in history
more remarkable than that which is
known by the above title. It displays
the daring character of the settlers
of New England at the period, as well
as the ferocious and crafty spirit of the
savages. It is a bloody story; yet it
may be well to make our readers acquainted
it.</p>

<p>Before the subjugation of Canada by
the British, the New England settlements
were constantly exposed to the hostilities
of the eastern Indians, and a spirit of
jealousy and revenge was kept up, not
only between the different nations, but
also between individuals. The boundaries
of the different territories being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
loosely defined, left both sides exposed
to real or fancied encroachments; so that
pretexts for war were always at hand.
The French Jesuits had planted themselves
among the Indian tribes at an
early period; and at the beginning of
the eighteenth century, they had two
churches among the eastern Indians, the
one at Penobscot, and the other at Norridgewock,
within the boundaries of the
present State of Maine.</p>

<p>At the latter resided the Jesuit Sebastian
Rasle, a man of talent, learning and
address, who, by accommodating himself
to the Indian mode of life, and maintaining
a gentle, condescending deportment,
had completely won the affection of the
savages, and his influence over them was
supreme. Knowing the power of superstition
over their minds, he took advantage
of this, and of their prejudice
against the English, to strengthen the
interest of the French among them. He
even made the offices of devotion serve
as incentives to their ferocity, and kept
a banner on which was depicted a cross
surrounded by bows and arrows, which
he was accustomed to hoist on a pole at
the door of his church, and gave the Indians
absolution, previous to their setting
out on a warlike expedition.</p>

<p>The governor of Canada held a constant
correspondence with this Jesuit,
and received through his hands information
of anything that transpired among
the tribes in that quarter. From these
individuals, the savages received every
encouragement to assert their title to
lands occupied by the English, and to
molest the settlers, by killing their cattle,
burning their haystacks, and robbing and
insulting them. Many of the inhabitants,
alarmed by these demonstrations of hostility,
removed from the frontiers in
1720. The garrisons were reinforced,
and scouting parties were sent abroad,
which checked, for a time, the hostile
movements of the Indians, who were
compelled, the same year, to give hostages
for their good behavior. This last
requisition was highly disrelished by the
governor of Canada, who renewed his
efforts to keep up the quarrel, and secretly
promised to supply the Indians with
arms and ammunition, although, as Great
Britain and France were not then at war,
he could not openly assist them. The
New England governments obtained information
of these intrigues; yet, though
highly incensed, they judged it best not
to rush into hostilities. The main dispute
lay between the Indians and the
proprietors of the eastern lands, and the
public were not directly concerned in it.
No blood had as yet been shed within
the limits of the English territory.</p>

<p>Rasle was considered to be the principal
instigator of the Indians, and it was
thought that if he were removed, all
would be quiet. A proposal was made
to send the sheriff of York county with
a posse of a hundred and fifty men, to
seize him and bring him to Boston; but
this bold stroke was not ventured upon.
In the summer of 1721, Rasle, in company
with the Count de Castine from
Penobscot, and Croisil from Canada, appeared
at one of the English garrisons,
and presented a letter, written in the
name of the several Indian tribes, to
Governor Shute of Massachusetts, declaring
that “if the English did not remove
in three weeks, they would kill them and
their cattle, and burn their houses.” The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
lands in question were comprehended
within the limits of the English patents,
and the settlers were considered the only
legal proprietors. They had been accustomed
to obtain regular deeds of sale from
the Indians, and pay them a valuable
consideration; but some of these titles
were of obscure and uncertain original,
and the memory of such transactions is
soon lost among people who possess no
written records. The Indians easily forget
the sales made by their ancestors, or
imagine that such bargains are not binding
upon their posterity.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts government, on
receiving this menacing epistle, sent an
additional force to the Maine frontier, and
being desirous to avoid a rupture, invited
the Indians to a conference, from which
the French emissaries were to be excluded.
This invitation was treated with
neglect; and in the succeeding winter,
a party under Colonel Westbrooke was
ordered to Norridgewock, to seize Rasle.
They reached the village undiscovered,
but before they could surround his house,
he had escaped into the woods, leaving
his papers in his strong box, which they
brought away without committing any
act of violence. Among these papers
were his letters of correspondence with
the governor of Canada, which afforded
positive proof that he was deeply engaged
in intrigues to incite the Indians to hostilities.
The savages were enraged at
this attempt to seize their spiritual father,
and resolved upon revenge. In the summer
of 1722, they made a descent upon
the settlements at Merry Meeting Bay,
and captured nine families. Dismissing
some of the prisoners, they retained
enough to secure the redemption of their
hostages in the hands of the English, and
sent them off to Canada. Their next
attack was on the fort at St. George, on
the Ameriscoggin, where they were repulsed
with considerable loss. They
afterwards surprized some fishing vessels
in the eastern harbors; and at length
made a furious attack on the town of
Brunswick, which they destroyed. These
hostilities determined the government of
Massachusetts to issue a declaration of
war against them, which was published
in form at Boston and Portsmouth, on
the 25th of July, 1722.</p>

Echoes.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">E<span class="smcap">choes</span> reside, for the most part, in
ruined abbeys, in caverns, and in
grottoes; they reverberate among
mountains, whisper in the areas of
antique halls, in the windings of long
passages and in the melancholy aisles
of arched cathedrals. There is an ancient
portico near the temple of Clymenos, in
the district of Cythonias, which repeats
every given sound three times.</p>

<p>At Woodstock there was one which
was said to have returned seventeen syllables
during the day, and twenty in the
night. In the sepulchre of Metella, the
wife of Sylla, an echo repeated five different
times, in five different keys; and
it is said that on the banks of a river,
near Coblentz, an echo recited seventeen
times. He who spoke or sung could
scarcely be heard, and yet the responses
were loud and distinct, clear and various;
sometimes appearing to approach,
and at other times to come from a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
distance, much after the manner of an
Æolian harp.</p>

<p>In the cemetery of the Abercorn family,
at Paisley, in the county of Renfrew,
there is an echo exceedingly beautiful
and romantic. When the door of the
chapel is shut, the reverberations are
equal to the sound of thunder. Breathe
a single note in music, and the note
ascends gradually with a multitude of
echoes, till it dies in soft and most bewitching
murmurs. If the effect of one
instrument is delightful, that of several
in concert is captivating, exciting the
most tumultuous and rapturous sensations.
In this chapel, lulled by ethereal
echoes, sleeps Margery, the daughter of
Bruce, the wife of Wallace and the
mother of Robert, king of Scotland.</p>

<p>A singular echo is heard in a grotto
near castle Comber, in Ireland. No reverberation
is observed till the listener is
within fifteen or sixteen feet of the extremity
of the grotto; at which place a
most delightful echo enchants the ear.
Most travellers have heard of the eagle’s
nest near Mucross Abbey, on the banks
of the lake of Killarney. This celebrated
rock sends forth the most fascinating
repercussion. Sound a French or bugle
horn, and echoes, equal to a hundred
instruments, answer to the call! Report
a single cannon, and the loudest thunders
reverberate from the rock and die in endless
peals along the distant mountains.</p>

<p>A nobleman’s seat about two miles
from Milan produces such a surprising
echo as can scarcely be equalled in the
world. Mr. Addison observed that upon
firing a pistol, he heard the sound returned
fifty-six times, though the air was
then foggy, and consequently not proper
for making an experiment to advantage.
At first, the repetitions were very quick,
but the intervals were greater in proportion
as the sound decayed. This astonishing
echo was probably never designed
by the architect, but it is occasioned
by two parallel walls of a considerable
length, between which the sound is reverberated
from one to the other till the
undulation is quite spent. Some persons
assert that the sound of one musical
instrument in this place resembles a
great number of instruments playing in
concert.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></p>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">lthough</span> I was gradually recovering
from the state of extreme weakness
to which I had been reduced, still, I
continued so feeble as to render it
impossible for me to proceed on my journey.
I continued therefore with my
kind friends at Maroontown, occasionally
taking a short walk about the place.
I soon became acquainted with a number
of the people. I was very much
gratified by the good-natured manner in
which everybody treated me. The
houses were extremely slight, many of
them consisting only of sticks set in the
ground, the roof and sides being formed
of a thatch of palm leaves. Others were
a little more substantial, the walls being
framed of mud and stone. The place
hardly seemed like the abode of human
beings, and when I gazed upon it, I fancied
that it was only the village of some
ingenious animals, a little elevated in the
scale of being above the beavers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>But notwithstanding this rude aspect
of their dwellings, the people themselves
seemed the most light-hearted and merry
set I ever beheld. Every night there
was music, and dancing, and laughter,
and frolic, and what seemed strange,
there was very little of riot or violence.
A good feeling seemed to pervade all
classes, and if they were poor, ignorant,
and in some respects degraded, they
seemed at least happy and kind-hearted.
There was very little government among
them, and though they had magistrates,
it was seldom necessary for these to
make any great show of authority.</p>

<p>While I was at this place, the old
woman, who spoke English, as I have
already mentioned, told me a good many
tales relating to the history of the place,
one of which I will give to my readers.</p>

<p>One of the earliest inhabitants of Maroontown
was King Congo. This personage
was born on the African coast,
and was the eldest son of one of the
petty kings in that quarter. He was
captured by a party of slavers, brought
to Paramaribo, and offered for sale as a
slave. He was a good-looking fellow,
about twenty years of age, of great
strength and daring courage. He was
readily purchased by a merchant of the
city, and became a servant in his family.
Submitting to his fate, he performed the
duties required of him with a tolerable
grace, though occasionally the remembrance
of his birth and former dignity
crossed his mind, and for a moment
caused his feelings to revolt from the
drudgery required of him.</p>

<p>It happened that one day, when he
was a little moody from reflections like
these, his master demanded of him some
service of more than ordinary servility.
Congo seemed to hesitate for a moment,
and stood looking his master in the face,
as if about to question his right thus to
command him. The latter, greatly incensed,
struck the negro in the face.
Congo, surprised and irritated, seized his
master by the collar, and was about to
dash him to the floor, when suddenly
recollecting himself, he unclenched his
hand and said, sneeringly, “I scorn to
wrestle with one so much weaker than
myself; but I will not serve a man who
treats me with such indignity.”</p>

<p>The rage of the master now knew no
bounds. He called aloud for his servants,
and as about a dozen of them
rushed into the room, he commanded
them to seize the offender. But Congo
was now thoroughly roused. As the
men seemed about to seize him, he retreated
to a corner of the room, seized a
chair, and, whirling it before him, defied
the whole party. These, knowing his
prodigious strength, and frightened by
his wild and threatening aspect, stood
aloof, afraid to grapple with such an enemy.
In vain were the threats of the
master. Finding it impossible to urge
them on, he seized a pair of pistols, and,
taking deliberate aim, discharged them
both at the offender. One of the balls
missed; the other entered the right arm
of Congo, and, shattering the bone, the
uplifted chair fell to the floor, and the
broken limb swung useless by his side.</p>

<p>Finding it in vain to resist farther, the
negro yielded, and being strongly bound,
was immediately taken to a public establishment,
kept for the purpose, and received
a hundred lashes upon the naked
back. The poor fellow was now shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
up in a small room, almost without light
or air, it being the purpose of his master
to subdue him by privation and suffering.
His arm was dressed, and care
was taken that he should not die, for
this would have been a serious loss to
the pocket of the proprietor.</p>

<p>At length, Congo recovered; but his
strength was wasted, and he could only
totter about with great effort. He was
now released, and his master, not fearing
him in his present enfeebled condition,
took him once more into his house.
Here he was treated with the greatest
harshness. He was required to labor
beyond his strength, and when he was
tardy from exhaustion, he was buffeted
either with the hand or foot of his lordly
proprietor.</p>

<p>Congo submitted to all this with apparent
humility, but a feeling was burning
within him which was destined ere
long to work out his deliverance.</p>

<p>In a few months his health and
strength were completely restored, and
though he continued to perform his duties
with alacrity, he was meditating
some plan by which he might escape
from his bondage. In this state of
things, it chanced that he was one day
passing by the public whipping-house,
when, hearing the lashes and screams
of the sufferer, he opened the door and
went in. He there saw a young woman
drawn upward by the wrists, so that
her feet were three or four inches from
the ground, while the executioner was
inflicting upon her back the number of
lashes commanded by her master.</p>

<p>For a moment the blood rushed to
Congo’s brain, and a dizzy feeling came
over him; but soon recovering, he rushed
up to the whipping-master, wrenched
the whip from his hand, threw him upon
the ground, and laid the weapon lustily
upon his back. He then cut the rope
which tied the hands of the suffering
girl, and rushed out of the place. Bewildered
with his own emotions, he walked
along the street, apparently unconscious
of his situation; but a loud shout, and a
posse of people at his heels, roused him
from his revery. Congo turned round,
faced his pursuers sternly for a moment,
and then, with a swift foot, set out for
the country.</p>

<p>For two miles he ran like a deer, but
finding that he was pursued by men on
horseback, he leaped over the banks of
the river Surinam, and plunged into the
water. Several of the horsemen came
up and discharged their pistols at the
fugitive, but he was beyond their reach.
He swam across the river; but here a
new danger awaited him. An immense
alligator lay upon the bank, and, as he
approached, sprung upon him. Nothing
could have saved Congo at this moment
but his strength and courage. As he
was approaching the shore, he saw the
alligator, and, drawing his knife from
his belt, he faced the monster, and,
plunging his knife down his open jaws,
killed him in an instant.</p>

<p>Delivered from this peril, Congo turned
round, shook his fist triumphantly toward
his pursuers who lined the opposite
bank of the river, and set forward
upon his journey toward the woody districts
that lay in the distance. These he
at last reached, and burying himself in
the recesses of the forest, he lived like a
wild animal upon the fruits that nature
afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>A party was soon made up and set
forth, for the purpose of capturing the
daring negro. They were provided
with guns, and attended by several
blood-hounds. The latter soon came
upon the track of the fugitive, and their
deep bellowing at once announced to
him his danger, and to the hunters that
the game was near at hand. Being
armed with a stout bludgeon, Congo departed,
and for nearly two days the
hounds were unable to overtake him.
At last, finding himself excessively fatigued,
he paused and determined to
await the approach of the dogs, and give
them battle. They soon came up, and
the leader sprang upon him. With a
single whirl of his club, the negro laid
the animal prostrate upon the earth.</p>

<p>In an instant, however, three more
were before him, ready to bury their
fangs in his flesh! With his uplifted
weapon, Congo looked the fierce animals
steadily in the eye. They paused for a
moment; but, overcoming their fear, they
sprang upon him. Two of them were
soon stretched lifeless upon the ground,
but a third seized Congo by the leg, and
brought him to the earth. The animal
then sprang at his throat, but the nimble
knife of the negro despatched him in the
very act. Wounded and bloody, the
poor fellow arose and dragged himself
forward. He was soon too faint to proceed,
and fell to the earth.</p>

<p>The hunters now came up, and seeing
that their dogs were killed, began to deliberate
as to the course they should pursue.
Congo, sheltered in the bushes,
saw and heard all that passed. They
concluded that it was in vain to pursue
the fugitive farther, and resolving to rest
themselves for a while, determined then
to return. Taking off their knapsacks,
they laid them down with their guns,
and three of the party went in search of
water, leaving the fourth behind. This
individual sat down upon the ground,
and, leaning against a tree, was soon
asleep.</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that Congo
watched these proceedings with great
interest. Waiting till the three men
were out of view, he issued from his
hiding-place, and carefully crept forward,
toward the slumbering hunter. The
latter, however, was but partially asleep,
and awaked by the rustling of the leaves,
saw the negro creeping upon him.
Amazement paralyzed him for a moment,
then springing to his feet, he
seized his gun and fired. The ball
missed, and, the instant after, he was
grappled in the arms of his formidable
enemy. After a momentary struggle,
they both fell, and Congo was uppermost.</p>

<p>What was his surprise, in looking in
the face of his prisoner, to see his former
master. Congo drew his knife from his
belt; the blade glittered aloft, and was
already descending to inflict a fatal blow,
when his purpose changed, and he said,
“It was your intention to kill me, and
were I in your place I should not have a
moment to live. But I will not imitate
a white man.” Saying this, he took the
straps of one of the knapsacks that lay
near him, and bound his prisoner firmly
on his back to the roots of a tree. Then
seizing the four muskets, the ammunition
and the knapsacks, he said, with a
smile, to the prostrate gentleman, “Good-bye,
massa,” and departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The huntsmen soon returned and released
their companion, but finding that
their guns were now in the hands of the
enemy, they thought it most prudent to
make a hasty retreat. While they returned
to Paramaribo, to be laughed at
for their defeat, Congo, well armed and
provisioned, secreted himself in the forest.
He was now too formidable to be
pursued, and soon meeting some of his
countrymen, who, like himself, had become
inhabitants of the wilderness, they
repaired to the present site of Maroontown,
and began to make a settlement.
Here they were speedily joined by other
fugitives, and the village, thus commenced,
soon became a considerable
town. Congo received the title of king,
and for many years continued to exercise
authority over the settlement.</p>

<p class="center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> is time to fulfil our promise in respect
to Inquisitive Jack. We have
but two or three chapters more to
give, in respect to his life and adventures,
and here is one of them. We have
told how Jack had become acquainted
with insects, birds, quadrupeds, and
other living things. We have now to
give some account of the manner in
which he became interested in botany,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
which means the science of plants, trees
and flowers. Of course, everybody is
fond of pretty flowers, roses, and lilacs,
and lilies, and peonies, and pinks, and
sweet peas, and other pretty blossoms.
And everybody must be interested in
trees, which furnish us with fruit, and
fuel, and shade; and they must be interested
in shrubs, which yield us so
many berries. But there is something
more in the history of these things, than
what at first meets the eye; and I am
now going to tell you something about
them.</p>

<p>Jack happened one day to go down
into the cellar, and he there saw a potato
which had been left upon the ground,
and which had now begun to put forth
several shoots. These were perfectly
white, and Jack asked himself why the
stalks of a potato in the cellar should be
white, while the stalks in the open air
were green. He watched the potato for
several days, and perceived that it was
growing quite rapidly. At length, one
thing greatly excited his curiosity. The
potato itself was lying behind a barrel,
and the stalk had grown around this,
and was now pointing its head upward
toward a low, narrow window, which
permitted a little light to enter the cellar.
The vine of the potato seemed to
be actually directing its course toward
this window, as if it really wanted to see
the light, and breathe the fresh air.</p>

<p>Greatly excited by these observations,
Jack continued to watch the potato from
day to day, at the same time musing with
himself as to what it could mean. “Has
this potato,” said he, thoughtfully, “got
sense and feeling? does it feel itself to
be a prisoner, and want to go out to see
the light and breathe the air? Who
has taught this plant to bend its way
toward the light, and lift up its head
and point its leaves toward that which it
seems to require?” Not being able to
satisfy these inquiries, the boy at last
went to his Aunt Betsey, and opened the
subject to her. This led to explanations,
the substance of which was as follows.</p>

<p>Plants or vegetables are organized
substances, which live and grow by the
aid of light, air, and moisture. They
need to be fed as much as animals, and
will as soon die without food, as an insect,
bird, or quadruped. Instead of
taking in their sustenance by means of
a mouth, they suck it up by means of
roots. These draw from the soil the
particular nutriment that is required in
the form of sap, and this is distributed
to the branches and leaves of the plant.
Heat and moisture are necessary in order
to set the sap in motion. Air and
light are imbibed by the leaves of the
plants. The various colors of plants are
drawn from the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>All plants are propagated by seeds.
These, however minute, contain all the
members of the parent plant—stalk, leaf
and flower. These are so nicely folded
up as not to be distinguished; but when
the plant begins to grow, you can see,
with the microscope, the several parts
unfolding, one by one, until at last they
assume the form of the plant from which
they sprung. It is said that the acorn,
which is the seed of the oak, contains all
the members of the future tree.</p>

<p>Jack was exceedingly delighted with
these curious facts, and, according to his
custom, he pursued the investigation of
the subject by his own observations, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
reading books, and by inquiries of his
intelligent and obliging aunt. In the
progress of his studies, he learned many
other curious facts, some of which we
must relate, for they are quite amusing.</p>

<p>Although plants have no sense or
thought, yet nature seems to have made
provision which supplies all their wants.
To prevent chestnuts and walnuts from
being devoured before they are ripe, the
former are covered with a prickly burr,
and the latter with an exceedingly bitter
rind. When these are ripe, the outer
coating bursts open, and lets out the imprisoned
fruit or seed. Similar contrivances
are observed in respect to a multitude
of other plants.</p>

<p>Some seeds, as those of apples, peaches,
plums, pears, cherries, currants, &amp;c.,
are covered up in a fleshy or pulpy substance,
which we call fruit. Here a
double purpose is answered. The seeds
are nicely taken care of, while mankind,
with many other creatures, are provided
with an ample store of delicious food.
But lest the seed should be destroyed
before it is brought to maturity, the fruit
is very sour or bitter, until the seeds are
quite ripe.</p>

<p>Thus we see that God, who has taken
such kind care of animals, by giving
them the power and skill to acquire their
food and perpetuate their existence, has
also taken care even of the life and prosperity
of plants. As these depend entirely
upon seeds for their propagation,
he has provided that these seeds shall
be wrapped up, protected, and nursed,
almost as carefully as little children.
Nor is this all. We might suppose that
a seed would fall from the tree, and finding
no other soil than that beneath the
shadow of its parent, it would shoot up
and perish for the want of light, and
heat, and air. But as children are able
to go from the parent roof and find
homes for themselves, so God has provided
that seeds shall emigrate from
their homes, and, scattering themselves
abroad, cover the face of nature with diversified
vegetation.</p>

<p>You will be curious to know how this
emigration of the seeds is brought about.
I will tell you. You have seen the thistle
down, in the autumn, rise upon the
air and go sailing along to a great distance.
That down has got a thistle-seed
attached to it, and it is carrying it along
to some place where it may rest, and being
imbedded by the rain in the soil, it
will shoot up into a thistle. Thus you
see the little seed is supplied with wings,
upon which it flies away from home, and
sets up for itself. One thistle will throw
off many thousands of these downy seeds,
and thus the race is multiplied.</p>

<p>There are many other plants that have
winged seeds, which are distributed in
the same way. Perhaps you think the
rough winds of autumn are unpleasant
and mischievous, but remember that
they shake myriads of seeds from the
plants and trees, and scatter them abroad
over the land. Nor is this the only way
in which seeds are disseminated. Birds
carry the stones of cherries, and the
seeds of various kinds of berries, from
the place where they are produced, to
other distant points.</p>

<p>Quadrupeds disperse the seeds of various
grasses and grains, by carrying
them from one point to another. The
burdock and the cockle seeds attach
themselves to the woolly fleece of animals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and are thus dispersed. Rains
carry seeds down the slopes of hills and
mountains, and rivers bear them from
one region to another.</p>

<p>Some seeds scatter themselves by
means of springs in their covering, furnished
by the plant itself. If you slightly
pinch the ripe seed-case of the pretty
flower of the gardens called the balsam,
it will burst asunder, and scatter the
seed in all directions. The pouch which
contains the seeds of the wood-sorrel,
also bursts and scatters them around
on all sides. The capsules of ferns
open with a spring. The seeds of some
species of this plant, when viewed
through a microscope, upon paper, seem
to be endowed with a kind of leaping
movement.</p>

<p>These and many other curious particulars
Jack learned about plants; but he
was not yet able to answer some of the
questions which had been suggested by
the potato in the cellar. How did this
plant know that it wanted light and air?
and what made it bend round the barrel,
and move forward toward the window?
Are plants endowed with feeling and
knowledge, which teaches them their
wants, and points out the means by
which these are to be satisfied? These
inquiries were pursued, and Jack at last
became acquainted with what is thought
by learned men upon these interesting
topics.</p>

<p>Animals are endowed with what is
called instinct, which is inherent or implanted
by God. The purpose of this is
to make them act in a manner to secure
food, to protect themselves from injury,
and in general to promote their happiness.
This instinct is sometimes distinct
from intelligence, and sometimes
mixed with it. In its simplest form, it
seems to be as involuntary as the beating
of the heart, or the circulation of the
blood. Thus a hen sits upon her eggs,
but the reason she does not know. She
is guided by some power as distinct
from her own knowledge, as is the beating
of her heart.</p>

<p>Now, we know nothing of this instinct,
except that it is a principle implanted by
God to promote the benefit of the species
to which it belongs; and that, at the
same time, it is totally different from
that intelligence which springs from
knowledge, and leads its possessor to
act in a particular manner, from its own
reflections. A species of instinct of a
lower grade is doubtless imparted to
plants. If seeds are cast into the soil in
the shade, as they require light, this instinct
impels them to creep, bend, and
rise, as the case may be, where it may
receive the light and air it requires.
Such was the conclusion to which our
young botanist arrived; and here we
must leave him for the present.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">
Lady Jane Grey.</h3>

<p class="center small">(Continued from page 61.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">fter</span> her marriage, Lady Jane led a
life of almost as great seclusion as
before; she pursued her studies and
maintained a correspondence in Latin
with the most eminent reformers in Germany.
She took little heed of the ambitious
designs of her parents; nay, it is
almost certain that she was purposely kept
in entire ignorance of them, and that the
first intimation which she had of her destiny,
was when the two dukes, attended
by other nobles, came to announce to her
the death of Edward, approaching her
with the respect and ceremony appropriate
to a sovereign. The intelligence
caused her both surprise and grief. She
refused to receive the crown, pleading
the superior right of her cousins Mary
and Elizabeth, and the little probability
that the people would recognize her
title. “But,” she continued, “if fortune
would give me warranties of her favor
and her constancies, should I be well
advised to take upon me this crown of
thorns, which would not fail to torment
me, though I were assured not to be
strangled with it? My liberty is better
than the chain you offer me, with what
precious stones soever it be adorned, or
of what gold soever framed. I will not
exchange my peace for honorable and
precious jealousies, for magnificent and
glorious fetters; and if you love me in
earnest, you will rather wish me a
secure and quiet fortune, though mean,
than an exalted condition exposed to the
world, and followed by some dismal
fall.”</p>

<p>But the nobles had proceeded too far
to be thwarted in their purpose by the
scruples or the disinclinations of a young
girl. Northumberland commanded and
threatened, Suffolk begged and entreated,
yet Lady Jane did not yield, notwithstanding
the habits of implicit obedience
in which she had been educated. A
new auxiliary was then brought into the
field; Lord Guilford Dudley, dazzled by
the brilliant destiny which seemed to
await him, was induced to exert his influence;
the wife could not withstand
his wishes, and surrendered her own
judgment to the will of her relations.</p>

<p>The sovereigns of England were wont
to pass the first days after their accession
at the Tower, in London; and, in compliance
with this custom, Lady Jane proceeded
thither, accompanied by a brilliant
cavalcade of nobility, of both sexes.
The streets through which she passed
were crowded with people, but it was
from curiosity rather than satisfaction;
no acclamations of joy saluted her,—an
omen which gave great encouragement
to the friends of Mary.</p>

<p>That princess, who was in the country
at the time of Edward’s death, in the mean
time was not idle, nor content to yield her
birthright without a struggle. As soon
as she learned what was passing at London,
she summoned the nobles to attend
upon her, and wrote to the council, expressing
her surprise, that she, the heir
to the throne, had yet received no official
notice of the death of the late sovereign.
Those members of this body, who, for
the most part, had yielded their assent
to the usurpation, through fear of Northumberland,
were now alarmed at the little
support which the act received from
the people, and were devising means to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
escape from the imprisonment, in which,
under the honorable name of attendance
upon Queen Jane, they were held in the
Tower. Their confinement was not of
long duration. On the 11th of July,
1553, Jane removed to the Tower, and
caused proclamation to be made of her
accession, at the usual places in London;
the people listening to the herald in
silence. On the 19th of the same month,
proclamation was made, at the same
places, of the accession of Queen Mary;
but the attendant circumstances were far
different on the occasion; the civic
authorities of the city seemed to accept
Mary as queen, and with such applause
was she received by the people, that,
from the commencement, not a word
more could be heard for the general
acclamations. A contemporary letter-writer
says that “the like triumphe was
never seen. The number of capps that
were thrown up at the proclamation
weare not to be tould. The Earl of
Pembroke threwe awaye his cap full of
angels. The bonfires weare without
number; and what with shoutynge and
criange off the people, and ringing of
belles, theare could no one man hear
almost what another sayd; besides banketynge
and skipping the streete for
joy.”</p>

<p>The news of what was passing in the
city produced a rapid change of policy in
the Tower. Many of the very counsellors,
who the day before had set their
hands to resolutions to stand by the Lady
Jane, hastened to be present at the
proclamation of Queen Mary, and despatched
messengers to that princess,
humbly soliciting her pardon for their
offences. Suffolk, as much dejected as
he had before been exalted, proceeded to
his daughter’s apartments, ordered all
the ceremonials of royalty to cease, and
admonished her to bear, with what patience
she could, a return to private life.
She was not at all discomposed; the
news, she said, was more welcome than
the summons which forced her against
her will to such an elevation. “In obedience
to you, my lord,” continued she,
“and to my mother, I acted a violence on
myself, and have been guilty of a grievous
offence; but the present is my own
act, and I willingly resign to correct
another’s fault, if so great a fault can be
corrected by my resignation and sincere
acknowledgment.” From this interview,
Suffolk proceeded to Tower Hill, where
he himself proclaimed Mary to be queen;
and then going to the council, set his
name to an order to Northumberland,
who was in command of the troops
raised by his partisans, to lay down his
arms and submit. That nobleman, upon
receipt of the news, had retreated to Cambridge,
“with more sad thoughts within
him than soldiers about him.” He there
proclaimed Queen Mary, “the beholders
whereof more believing the grief in his
eyes, when they let down tears, than the
joy professed by his hands, when he
threw up his cap.”</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the new council,
was to issue an order for the separation
of Lady Jane from her husband,
and the removal of both from the royal
apartments to those designed for prisoners
of state. The execution of the order
was entrusted to Bishop Gardiner. We
have no historical record of the manner
in which he executed the task, which
his zeal for popery made a work of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
pleasure; but we can readily believe that
Shakspere has truly delineated the scene.</p>

<p>But to return to history. The conduct
of Lady Jane in this sudden transition
was such as was to be expected
from one so humble, gentle, and pious.
“She had,” says Bishop Burnet, “a mind
wonderfully raised above the world; and
at the age wherein others are but imbibing
the notions of philosophy, she had
attained to the practice of the highest
precepts of it; for she was neither lifted
up with the hope of a crown, nor cast
down when she saw her palace made
afterwards her prison; but carried herself
with an equal temper of mind in
those great inequalities of fortune that so
suddenly exalted and depressed her.”
In the words of the quaint Fuller, “she
made misery itself amiable by her pious
and patient behavior; adversity, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
night clothes, becoming her, as well as
her day dressing, by reason of her pious
disposition.”</p>

<p>On the 19th of November, Lady Jane
and her husband were arraigned for
high treason. Conscious that a defence
would be useless, they each pleaded
guilty. The description of the scene, as
given by contemporaries, has been well
embodied by the poet already quoted.
Bishop Gardiner, in reply to the expostulations
of one of the council in favor
of mercy, is represented as speaking
thus:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1">“These are romantic, light, vain-glorious dreams.</div>
    <div class="i1">Have you considered well upon the danger?</div>
    <div class="i1">How dear to the fond many, and how popular,</div>
    <div class="i1">These are whom you would spare? Have you forgot</div>
    <div class="i1">When at the bar, before the seat of judgment,</div>
    <div class="i1">This Lady Jane, this beauteous traitress, stood,</div>
    <div class="i1">With what command she charmed the whole assembly?</div>
    <div class="i1">With silent grief the mournful audience sat,</div>
    <div class="i1">Fixed on her face, and listening to her pleading:</div>
    <div class="i1">Her very judges wrung their hands for pity;</div>
    <div class="i1">Their old hearts melted in them as she spoke,</div>
    <div class="i1">And tears ran down upon their silver beards.</div>
    <div class="i1">E’en I myself was moved, and for a moment</div>
    <div class="i1">Felt wrath suspended in my doubtful breast,</div>
    <div class="i1">And questioned if the voice I heard was mortal.</div>
    <div class="i1">But when her tale was done, what loud applause,</div>
    <div class="i1">Like bursts of thunder, shook the spacious hall!</div>
    <div class="i1">At last, when sore constrained, the unwilling lords</div>
    <div class="i1">Pronounced the fatal sentence on her life;</div>
    <div class="i1">A peal of groans ran through the crowded court</div>
    <div class="i1">As every heart was broken, and the doom,</div>
    <div class="i1">Like that which waits the world, were universal.”</div>

<p>It has been supposed that Mary had,
at this moment, no sanguinary purposes
in view, but merely hoped by the terrors
of a scaffold, and in the seclusion of a
prison, to recall the youthful pair from
the path of heresy. With this view, she
caused the most solemn promises of life
and fortune to be made to Lady Jane, if
she would recant; the most learned
divines of the Catholic faith were sent to
reason with her, and to endeavor to turn
her from that faith which she had held
from her cradle; “each striving by art,
by flattery, by threatening, by promise
of life, or whatever else might move most
in the bosom of a weak woman, who
should become master of so great a
prize; but all their labors were bootless,
for she had art to confound their art,
wisdom to withstand their flatteries, resolution
above their menaces, and such a
true knowledge of life, that death was to
her no other than a most familiar acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Indeed, supported as she was by the
almost unanimous voice of the English
people, Mary had little cause to fear her
innocent rivals. She seems to have felt
thus, for many little indulgences were
granted to them; though not permitted
to see one another, they were allowed
such freedom within the walls of the
Tower, as was not inconsistent with
their safe-keeping.</p>

<p>But whatever hopes they might have
entertained were quickly taken away by
an unhappy event, which it was impossible
for them to foresee, and in which it
is not so much as pretended that they
were parties. The cruelty and bigotry
of Philip of Spain had made his very
name detestable in England; when,
therefore, the queen announced her determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
to marry him, the whole
kingdom was thrown into consternation.
The most strenuous efforts were made
to dissuade her from her purpose; but,
these failing, a general insurrection was
concerted, having for its object the
substitution of the protestant Elizabeth
for Mary upon the throne.</p>

<p>Their plans were not yet fully matured,
when the arrest of some of those
concerned, though for some entirely distinct
cause, alarmed Sir Thomas Wyatt,
the leader, and drove him into premature
rebellion. The queen, when she heard
of his rising, sent a herald to command
him to dismiss his followers. The herald
found the moat about Sir Thomas’
house filled with water, and the drawbridge
up; at one spot a ford seemed to
offer a safe passage. “On the inside
thereof walked the proper case of a man
well habited, and his face carrying no
despair of wisdom therein. The herald
asked him, ‘whether he might safely
go over there?’ To whom the other
slily replied, ‘Yea, yea;’ but had not the
strength of his horse been more than
ordinary, he either had been drowned in
the water, or buried in the mud.” The
herald, on arriving at the house, made
loud complaints of the deceit practised
upon him; when Sir Thomas summoned
all his household to answer the charge.
“The herald challengeth the party at the
first sight of him. ‘Alas!’ said Sir
Thomas, ‘he is a mere natural, as will
appear, if you will please to examine
him.’ ‘Why, sirrah,’ said the herald,
‘did you direct me to come over where it
was almost impossible to pass without
drowning?’ To whom the other answered,
‘The ducks came over not long
before you, whose legs were shorter than
your horse’s.’ Hereat the herald smiled
out his anger, adding withal, ‘Sir Thomas,
hereafter let your fool wear his
motley, that he may deceive no more in
this kind.’”</p>

<p>The infatuation of Suffolk sealed his
daughter’s fate. No sooner did he hear
of Wyatt’s being in arms than he hastened
down into Leicestershire and summoned
the people to join him in rebellion;
but his own tenants disregarded
the call; he was seized by the queen’s
officers and carried to London. The
father’s treason was imputed to the
daughter, and one of the first acts of the
queen and her council, after the suppression
of the rebellion, was to order the
execution of the sentence which had
been hanging over the head of Lady
Jane and her husband. Jane heard the
annunciation with gladness; she was
prepared for death, which she looked
upon as the termination of her miseries
and her entrance into eternal happiness.
But she was not suffered to pass the four
days of life which were allowed her, in
quiet; her devotions were disturbed by
the priests who, by the queen’s command,
sought, by perpetual disputations,
to bring about what they called a timely
conversion. But their efforts, though
renewed on each day, were unsuccessful;
“her faith, being built on the rock
of Christ, was by no worldly persuasion
or comfort to be either moved or shaken;
so that after the expense of time, and the
loss of much speech, they left her, a lost
and forsaken member; but she prayed
for them, and with a most charitable
patience endured their worst censures.”</p>

<p>It had been the original intention of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the queen that the youthful couple
should suffer together on Tower-hill,
but the council, dreading the compassion
of the people for their youth, beauty, and
innocence, changed the orders, and gave
directions that Lord Guilford should suffer
on the Hill, but that Lady Jane
should be executed within the walls of
the Tower. On the morning of the fatal
day, Lord Guilford desired permission to
see his wife. The queen granted the
permission, but Lady Jane refused to
permit the interview; sending him word,
that the tenderness of their parting would
overcome the fortitude of both, and would
too much unbend their minds from the
constancy which was required of them.
She added, that their separation would
be but for a moment; and that they
would soon rejoin each other in a scene
where their affections would forever be
united, and where death and disappointment
could no longer have access to them
to disturb their happiness.</p>

<p>On his way to the gate, Lord Guilford
passed directly under the window of his
wife, and from thence she took one last
parting look in the world, giving him a
signal of remembrance; and when he
was no more to be seen she sat down
with apparent tranquillity, and waited
the arrival of her own appointed hour.
When she heard the rumbling of the
cart which brought back the lifeless
remains of her husband, she rose, and
walked to the window under which it
passed. Her attendants would have
prevented her, but she declared that the
constancy of his end had given a confirmation
to her mind adequate to counterbalance
the shock of this sad spectacle;
and she is then said to have exclaimed,
“O Guilford! Guilford! the antepast is
not so bitter that you have tasted, and
that I shall soon taste, as to make my
flesh tremble; but that is nothing compared
to the feast that you and I shall
this day partake of in heaven!”</p>

<p>When the officer appeared to summon
her to the scaffold, she followed him
with the most perfect calmness; there
was no change of countenance, nor any
evidence of discomposure. She mounted
the steps without hesitation, and waited
quietly till silence was procured, and
then addressed a few simple words to
the spectators; avowing her steadfastness
in the Protestant faith. The executioner,
on his knees, besought her forgiveness,
which she sweetly and willingly
accorded to him. She then bound
the handkerchief over her eyes, and
feeling for the block, said, “What shall
I do? Where is it!” At these questions
one of the persons on the scaffold
guided her towards the block, on which
she instantly laid her head, and then
stretching forth her body, exclaimed,—“Lord,
into thy hands I commit my
spirit!” A pause of one moment ensued,
the axe fell,—and the lovely and pious
victim to ambition and bigotry rejoined
her husband in heaven!</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Lord Mayor’s Show.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> chief officer of the city of London
is called the Lord Mayor. He is
chosen by the citizens of that metropolis,
and on the day in which he
assumes his office, he rides about the
streets of London in a splendid gilt
coach, attended by other coaches, and
men dressed up in military hats, with
tall feathers. Their coats and pantaloons
are almost covered with gold lace.
The heads of the horses and the harnesses
are decorated with gilt stars and
bouquets of ribbons.</p>

<p>The driver of the Lord Mayor’s coach
looks almost smothered with his big hat,
and the immense mass of gilt lace upon
the collar of his coat. The Lord Mayor
himself is very gaily dressed. I once
saw this show, and it appeared to me
that the Lord Mayor and all his attendants
looked more like images or idols,
bedizened with finery, than like human
beings.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor goes to Black Friar’s
bridge, where he and his attendants enter
a splendid barge. They are then
rowed to Westminster bridge, where
they land and proceed to the Westminster
Hall, where the Lord Mayor takes
the oath of office. He then returns to
his barge, lands at Black Friar’s bridge,
and reënters his coach. The grand procession
is attended by the banners of the
city companies, and, after marching about
the principal streets, they proceed to
Guildhall, where they have a sumptuous
dinner.</p>

<p>Wherever the Lord Mayor goes on
this occasion, there are crowds of boys
and other persons following him. When
he is on the river, he is surrounded by a
multitude of boats, with flags waving in
the air, and when he passes along the
streets, the ladies wave their handkerchiefs
from the windows.</p>

<p>The people of London seem very
much delighted with this exhibition.
Indeed, they seem to think that he who
gives them the best show is the best
mayor.</p>

<p>These spectacles are of very ancient
date. Formerly the kings and queens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
used to parade the streets of the city,
dressed up in gaudy finery, and all the
young people admired these things, for
it was always a holiday, when such a
spectacle took place. In modern times,
kings and queens are not so fond of
showing themselves. The present queen,
Victoria, seems to have partially restored
the old custom, for she may be frequently
seen travelling about the country.
She has the good sense, however, to
dress modestly, and like other ladies.</p>

<p>But as the pageantry of kings and
queens has grown into disuse, the people
of London seem to think more of
Lord Mayor’s day. In 1837, the Lord
Mayor’s procession was attended by two
gigantic figures on horseback, called
Gog and Magog. In 1841, the procession
was accompanied by a model of a
full-rigged ship; she was manned by
boys from the naval school, who performed
all the evolutions like thorough-bred
sailors. It was placed in a car,
drawn by six horses.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor’s coach was built in
the year 1757, almost one hundred years
ago. It cost about five thousand dollars,
and its pannels were decorated with
paintings by Cipriani, a celebrated artist
of that day. The engraving at the head
of this article gives a good idea of this
famous vehicle.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">Joan of Arc.</h3>

<p class="center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> village of Domremi, near Vaucouleurs,
on the borders of Lorraine, is
distinguished as the birth-place of
the celebrated Joan of Arc, in the
year 1402. Born in a humble sphere
of life, her education was limited. Her
parents, James D’Arc and Isabella Romé,
were poor, and not being able to educate
Joan, sent her, when still young, to take
the situation of servant in a small inn.
Having a robust frame, and an active
temper, she employed herself in a manner
rather unsuited to her sex, in currying
the horses of the people who frequented
the inn, and riding them to
water. In short, she took pleasure in all
the active occupations attending the situation,
at the same time that her conduct
and manners were entirely free from reproach.</p>

<p>At this time, the situation of France
was very interesting and critical, roused
the attention, and formed a constant
theme for conversation in all parts of the
kingdom, and among all ranks of people.
The prince having been expelled from
his throne, the kingdom was of course in
a state of division and anarchy. At the
same time, the English army were laying
siege to Orleans, whose inhabitants were
making the greatest efforts to avert their
probable fate. Joan listened with interest
to the news, as it was repeated by the
changing guests of the inn; all the “rumors
of wars” reached her ears, and
struck her imagination. She listened
with daily increasing interest to the story
of the unfortunate dauphin, till her
bosom was filled with a sentiment of loyal
attachment to his cause. She pondered
on the probable means of his deliverance,
and dwelt upon the miseries of her
country till her mind became disordered
and bewildered, and she thought that
she was impelled, by supernatural voices,
to expel the enemies of her bleeding
country. Her mind was filled with visions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
her heart with high hopes, and her
habits of life and fearless temper urged
her on to the accomplishment of that
which her youth and sanguine ardor led
her to deem possible.</p>

<p>Filled with these fancies, she could no
longer remain in the inactive sphere in
which her parents had placed her; she
was no longer content, and, packing up
her small wardrobe, she returned to her
family, and communicated to them her
projects and her hopes. Touched by
her enthusiasm, her friends accompanied
her to Vaucouleurs, where the governor,
whose name was Baudricourt, resided.
Having obtained admission, she imparted
her mission, told him her high hopes,
painted to him in glowing colors the visions
that had visited her from above, and
conjured him to aid her in effecting the
great object she had at heart. Above
all, she warned him not to treat with
neglect or contempt the revelations of
God. The governor at first deemed her
insane and unworthy of attention, but at
length, impressed by her perseverance,
and by the representations of a gentleman
by the name of Longport, who had
conceived a high idea of the character
of Joan, he had her conducted to the
French court, which was then residing
at Chinon.</p>

<p>It is pretended by those addicted to
the marvellous, that Joan, having offered
in the name of the Supreme Being, to
raise the siege of Orleans, to conduct the
dauphin to Rheims, and there to anoint
him king, she impressed him with a
strong sense of her divine authority, by
confiding to him a secret which he supposed
only known to himself. She is
said to have described minutely a sword
which was kept in a certain church, and
which she had never seen. She also
required this instrument to aid her in the
victories that she expected and promised
to perform. Hope and enthusiasm now
combined to animate the drooping spirits
of the royalists. Heaven itself appeared
to smile on their cause, and declare itself
in their favor. The affairs of the
king were in too desperate a state to reject
any means, however insufficient or
romantic, which might flatter the hopes
of his adherents, and faith and confidence
silenced the cold suggestions of
reason.</p>

<p>After many debates in parliament,
many scruples among the king and his
ministers, and various investigations by
the divines of the pretensions of the prophetess,
her wishes were complied with,
and, mounted on horseback, and armed
cap-a-pie, Joan exhibited herself to the
admiring populace. Her fine figure, animated
face, and the graceful manner in
which she managed her pawing steed,
added to the popular enthusiasm. Shouts
and acclamations rent the air; her former
occupations were forgotten; chivalry, religion
and sentiment united to captivate
the fancy and influence the hearts of the
multitude.</p>

<p>All things being now ready, preparations
were made to put in execution the
plans of the heroine. A large convoy,
escorted by ten thousand men, and headed
by Joan, were ordered to march to
Orleans. Mounted on a white horse,
her head crowned with a helmet, she
bore in her hand a consecrated banner.
In her prophetic character, she insisted
that the convoy should enter Orleans by
the direct road from the side of Beausse;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
but Dunois thought proper to differ from
the maid, and conducted his troops on
the opposite side of the river, where the
enemy were less strongly entrenched.
Previous to their march, Joan had addressed
a letter to the English generals,
exhorting them to leave the country, and
not to resist the will of God, whose commission
she bore. The officers treated
her pretensions with derision and scorn,
and ridiculed the desperate situation of
the dauphin, who had recourse to so absurd
an expedient to improve his condition.
The soldiers, however, were affected
with superstitious terror by the
stories which had reached their camp,
and were many of them nearly deprived
of courage and confidence.</p>

<p>While the convoy approached the
river, the inhabitants of Orleans sent
boats to receive the provisions, while
Joan protected them with her troops.
The English did not venture to attack
her, and after accomplishing their purpose,
the French returned in safety to
Blois. The complete success of this
undertaking produced a corresponding
effect upon the minds of both parties.
Joan made a triumphal entry into Orleans,
and was received as one sent from
heaven by the enraptured citizens.</p>

<p>The next convoy which was sent to
Orleans, entered, as formerly desired by
Joan, on the other side of the river.
Struck with panic, the besiegers offered
no resistance, but allowed the convoy to
proceed straight through their redoubts,
in silence and consternation. The English
general saw himself placed in a
most extraordinary and perilous situation;
the minds of his troops were unnerved
by a fanatic influence, against
which valor had no effect, their spirits
were depressed, and thus everything
conspired in favor of the besieged, and
led the way to further triumphs.</p>

<p>Joan, reading at a glance the situation
of the English soldiers, and profiting by
the ardor inspired by this fortunate train
of circumstances, now addressed the garrison,
and exhorted them to make a sally
upon the enemy. Waving her consecrated
banner, she called upon the generals
to aid her, and the troops, thus assured
of the assistance of Heaven, poured with
fury upon the English, whose forces,
unnerved by superstition, were cut to
pieces, and many of them taken captive.
Such was the panic, that Sir John Talbot,
who arrived at this time with troops
for the relief of the garrison, retired
again, not daring to attack the victorious
and heaven-led army.</p>

<p>The maid and her followers, excited
by success, and not doubting that they
could carry everything before them, now
proposed to attack the main body of the
enemy. Dunois, who had more discretion,
though equal zeal, urged them
rather to attack the English forts, which
lay on the opposite side of the <a id="chg5"></a>river. To
this Joan consented; the forts were assailed,
and, for a moment, the French
were repulsed, but the inspired maid,
animating her troops by her voice, her
gestures, and her lofty bearing, rallied
her recreant troops, led them back to the
charge, and was completely victorious.
Having received a wound in the neck
from an arrow, she retired behind the
troops, and extracting the weapon with
her own hands, she exclaimed, “It is
glory, and not blood, which flows from
this wound.” After having it slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
dressed, she returned, placed herself
again at the head of her victorious
troops, and succeeded in planting her
victorious standard on the enemy’s ramparts.</p>

bluff eighty feet high, upon the south side of
Lake Erie. The streets are straight, and cross
each other at right angles. You can look out
upon the lake from many of the streets, and as
it is seventy miles wide, on the north side you
cannot see the land.</p>

<p>The streets are very level, and many of the
houses are handsome. I was once at New
Haven, in Connecticut, and I think some of the
streets in Cleveland look like some of those in
New Haven. We have, however, no mountains,
like East and West Rock. Indeed, the
country is flat around Cleveland, and, far as the
eye can reach, you can see nothing like a
mountain.</p>

<p>The river Cayahogo empties into the lake
west of the town. At the mouth of this is our
harbor, and here you see a great many small
vessels. Some of these come from Buffalo,
some from Detroit, some from Canada, some
from Sandusky, and some from other places.
They often carry away four or five thousand
barrels of flour in a single day. Fine steamboats
come here every day, and at this season
we see many people in them from Boston, New
York, and Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Thus you see, Mr. Merry, though we are so
far from Boston, we are not quite out of the
world. The steamboats go almost a thousand
miles farther north and west than we are, and I
am told that some of the emigrants, when asked
to what place they are going, say, “to Sun
Down.”</p>

<p>I have now filled my paper, though I ought
to tell you that this is a very cheap place to live
in. You can buy a barrel of flour for three dollars;
a ton of excellent coal for two dollars and
fifty cents; eggs for six cents a dozen; and a
wild turkey for twenty-five cents. If any of
your friends can’t find room enough in Boston,
let them come out here, and we will take care
of them. A letter of introduction from you will
ensure them a welcome.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> is October. The “sere and yellow
leaf” is in the forest; the birds, one
by one, have departed, and stillness
begins to settle over the scenes where
the ceaseless minstrelsy of the feathered
tribes had prevailed. Yet the landscape
is still beautiful: the woods have put on
their “coat of many colors;” the nuts
are beginning to fall, and the squirrels
have to dispute with the boys and girls
the possession of their first fruits.</p>

<p>Every season has its appropriate work
to perform in the great household of
nature: the winds of October and November
disseminate the seeds which have
been matured during the summer. The
thistle down is now seen emigrating on
its noiseless wing, bearing its little seed
to some place where it may “settle.” A
thousand other seeds are scattered by the
winds and the waters, and thus the face
of nature is covered with its variegated
garments of vegetation.</p>

<p>We cannot do better than to close our
notice of October, with an old piece of
wit, which, however common, will bear
repeating.</p>

<p class="center">ECHO GIVES A LESSON.</p>

<p>It is October; the winds have left the
forest and the field; the busy birds have
ceased their labors, and have either departed,
or sit songless upon the trees.
Stillness settles at noon-day over the
landscape. Step over into the valley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>

<h3 class="h3head">The Chinchilla.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> pretty little animal is six inches
long, with small rounded ears, large
black eyes, and a tail of moderate
length. It is a species of field rat,
found in the northern parts of Chili, in
South America. It lives in burrows,
and feeds upon the roots of bulbous
plants. Its fur is in great esteem, being
very fine and of an ash gray color. It
is very docile in temper, and extremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
timid. If placed in the bosom, it remains
as still and quiet as if it were in
its own nest. It is very agile, and can
leap to the height of several feet, its hind
legs being longer than the fore legs. It
usually sits upon its haunches, and is
able to raise itself up and stand upon its
hinder feet. It feeds in a sitting posture,
grasping its food in its fore paws,
in the same manner as the squirrel.</p>

<p>There is a variety of the chinchilla in
Peru, but it is larger in size, and the fur
is not so fine as that of the Chilian animal.
It is equally good-tempered, and
mild in its disposition, and, when domesticated,
is very tame and playful.</p>

<p>Great numbers of these animals are
caught, by boys with dogs, and sold to
traders, who take them to Santiago.
The extensive use of the fur has occasioned
great destruction of them. The
ancient Peruvians made coverlets for
beds of this fur.</p>

<p>A Spanish writer, in 1591, thus mentions
this animal: “The chinchilly is a
kind of small beasts, like squirrels; they
have a wonderful smooth and soft skin,
which the people wear as a healthful
thing to cover those parts which have
need of a moderate heat.”</p>

<p>A seaman, in 1593, also describes
them: “In Peru, they have little beastes,
like unto a squirrel, but that hee is gray;
his skinne is the most delicate, soft, and
curious furre that I have seene, and of
much estimation as is reason; few of
them go into Spain, because difficult to
be come by, for that the princes and
nobles laie waite for them. They call
this beast Chinchilla, and of them they
have great abundance.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Branch of Elder.</h3>

<p class="center">A FABLE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">hunter</span> was wandering along over the
fields with his son, and a deep brook
flowed between them. The boy wished
to go over to his father, but was
unable, for the brook was very wide.
Immediately he cut a branch from a bush,
placed it in the brook, leaned fearlessly
upon it, and with all his force gave a
sudden spring. But behold! it was the
branch of an elder-tree, and as the boy
was swinging over the brook, the staff
broke in the middle, he fell into deep
water, a splash was heard, and the tide
closed over him.</p>

<p>A shepherd saw what had happened,
from a distance, and raising an alarm,
ran towards the brook. But the boy blew
the water from him, and swam, laughing,
to the shore.</p>

<p>Then the shepherd said to the hunter,
It appears that your son has been
well instructed, but one thing you have
forgotten. Why have you not taught
him to examine within, before he opens
his heart to confidence? Had he discovered
the weak pith that was concealed,
he would not have trusted the deceiving
bark!</p>

<p>Friend, answered the hunter, I have
sharpened his eye, and improved his
strength, and I can now trust him to experience.
Time must teach him to be
suspicious. But he will persevere in
the discovery, for his eye is clear, and
his strength is practised.</p>

Dick Boldhero.</h3>

<p class="center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was more than two months after my
arrival at Maroontown, before I was
in a condition to depart. Finding that
I should not be able to return to Paramaribo
in season to go back to Connecticut
with my vessel, I sent word to the
captain, requesting him to see my mother
and sister, and tell them what detained
me.</p>

<p>When I had sufficiently recovered to
travel, I set out from Maroontown, having
taken leave of my kind friends there.
The negro who had rescued me, together
with his family, had done everything in
their power to make me comfortable and
happy. The neighbors too had shown
the greatest interest in my behalf; they
were constantly sending me every sort
of delicacy, such as small game and the
choicest fruits. Never have I met with
a people so little selfish, and to whom
hospitality seemed to be so natural.
Some of them really shed tears as I departed,
and even offered to accompany
me on my journey. I accepted the latter
proposition in part, and accordingly
a young man set out to be my guide for
the first day.</p>

<p>I had heard at Maroontown something
about the Englishman whom I was going
to visit. I learned that he was a
coffee planter with a large estate; but I
had discovered that his residence, instead
of being a hundred miles from Paramaribo, was
nearly double that distance. This
taught me a good lesson, which I recommend
to the attention of my readers; it
is this—before setting out upon a journey,
be sure to ascertain how far you
have to go.</p>

<p>It was now December—a time when
the winter had already commenced in
New England, but it was very different
in Guiana. I found the weather very
warm, and my strength was so impaired
by my sickness, that the first day I did
not proceed more than eight miles. I
slept at a small plantation, and the next
morning, having taken leave of my
guide, I proceeded alone upon my journey.
For three days, nothing particular
occurred. The country was slightly undulating,
and portions of it were exceedingly
fertile. Here and there was a
plantation, but a large part of the land
was covered with forests. On the fourth
day after my departure, I met with a curious
adventure. There is in this region
a species of wild hog called peccary.
In some parts, they are numerous,
and I had frequently seen them crossing
my path in the course of my travels.
They seemed not to be very shy, yet, as
I approached them, they would usually
start off with a kind of grunt, or bark,
and hide themselves in the bushes.</p>

<p>On the occasion just referred to, I
chanced to see a peccary, with a litter of
young ones, lying by the side of my
path. When I came near, they sprang
up and ran away. I however gave chase,
and soon caught one of the little pigs.
The fellow instantly set up the most vociferous
squealing—upon this, the mother
turned back and came upon me with
savage ferocity. Her mouth was open,
and she uttered a sort of bellowing that
was quite frightful. I was not disposed
to yield my prize at once, but holding on
to the hind legs of the pig with the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
hand, and flourishing my club in the
right, I faced the infuriated dam. She
hesitated a little, but kept up her cry. In
a few minutes, I saw issuing from the
adjacent thickets several other peccaries,
apparently coming to the rescue. They
immediately advanced, and I was soon
surrounded with more than forty of these
raging beasts.</p>

<p>Affairs were now getting serious, and
I thought it best to release the little prisoner,
hoping that this would pacify the
tumult. But the tempest was not so easily
appeased. The bristly mob still encircled
me, grunting, squealing, barking,
and bellowing, while, at the same time,
their tusks were displayed, ready to rend
me in pieces. I was obliged to keep
wheeling round, brandishing my club,
occasionally giving an obtrusive snout a
pretty hearty thump by way of caution.
The storm, however, seemed to thicken,
and it was obvious that the whole troop
would soon rush upon me. In this extremity,
discretion seemed the better part
of valor, and concluding that I had better
risk my honor than my life, I took advantage
of an open space, sprang through
the circle, and leaped into the branches
of a tree that was near by.</p>

<p>The disappointed assailants pursued
me, and encircling the tree, vented their
rage in grunts and groans. Never did I
see such a hubbub. Sitting upon the
limbs of the tree in perfect safety, I looked
down and laughed very heartily at
the scene. There was one boar who
seemed particularly anxious to signalize
himself. He had enormous long tusks,
and in his fury, he frothed at the mouth,
and kept up a great outcry. He was
probably the captain of the troop, for he
generally led the way, and a party of a
dozen supporters were always at his
heels.</p>

<p>I could not forbear the pleasure of stirring
up this Hector of the field with an
occasional poke across the back with my
shillaleh. It was amusing to see his indignation,
blent with his courage. He
rose upon his hind legs, and looked defiance
with all his might. There was
something about him which seemed to
say—“Come down here, you coward;
come down, and we’ll give you a peeling.”
I did not, however, accept the
challenge, though I would have been
willing to have tried my hand with him in
single combat. Forty to one was rather
too many, and so I remained in my castle.</p>

<p>Rage, like everything else, must have
its end; so, in the course of half an hour,
the chivalry of these pigs began to abate.
Two or three of them slipped off into the
bushes, and their example was soon followed
by others. In the course of half
an hour, they were all dispersed except
the commander-in-chief, and even he, at
last, took his departure, having expressed
his contempt and defiance in a few significant
grunts. I waited till the whole
troop had vanished. I then cautiously
descended, and proceeded with a light step
upon my way. I looked back several
times, and scrutinized the thickets that
lay along my path. I travelled pretty
rapidly for three or four miles, and I may
as well confess that I breathed much
more freely when I found I had distanced
the enemy. It may seem ridiculous that
one should be seriously frightened at such
an attack, yet the scene dwelt for some
time in my memory, and for several
nights, my dreams were embellished with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
images drawn from the swinish mob
that had assailed me in the woods.</p>

<p>I now continued my journey, and at
the end of eight days, I reached the place
of my destination. I found the person
whom I sought to be a fat, burly Englishman,
named Hartley, possessing about
a hundred negroes, all of whom were engaged
in the cultivation of coffee. When
I told him my errand, he looked at me
with surprise, and seemed at first to be
in doubt whether he should answer my
inquiries. At last, having satisfied himself
that I had no sinister object in view,
he told me the story which shall be related
in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></p>

<p>“Your uncle,” said Mr. Hartley, “was
directed to Surinam rather by chance
than choice. He fled from St. Domingo
during the troubles there. The vessel
in which he came was the only one
which offered him an immediate chance
of escape, and as his life was in danger,
he went on board of her. When he
reached Paramaribo, he had considerable
property, and thinking that the place offered
him fair prospects, he invested his
money in ships, and established himself
as a merchant. He was very enterprising,
and for a time, successful. His
manners were pleasing, and he won the
good will of every body around him. He
paid his addresses to the daughter of a
rich planter, and soon married her.</p>

<p>“He thus became allied to one of the
first families in Surinam. This circumstance,
added to others of a favorable character,
soon gave him an eligible standing
in society. But suddenly a blight
came over his prospects, and his descent
was even more rapid than his elevation.</p>

<p>“After he had been at Paramaribo
about three years, he deemed it necessary
to go to Amsterdam. Having adjusted
his business there, he took passage
in one of his own ships, to return.
She was said to be richly laden, and, according
to his statement, had merchandize
on board to the amount of more than
two hundred thousand dollars. Previous
to her departure, he sent to Surinam, and
had insurance effected there to the amount
of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
upon the ship and cargo. He returned
to Paramaribo, stating that his vessel
was wrecked upon one of the West India
Islands in a gale, and that the ship and
cargo were entirely lost; he, with the
captain and two hands only, being saved
by swimming to the shore.</p>

<p>“Under these circumstances, he claimed
the insurance; but this was refused
by the company. Your uncle brought
an action against them; but an affidavit
was produced in court, signed by the
captain and the two hands, declaring that
the ship was run on shore by your uncle’s
orders; his purpose being to destroy
the vessel and then claim the insurance,
which was said to be twice the amount
of the real cost. The astonishment
that prevailed through the city of Paramaribo
at these disclosures cannot be described.
Your uncle breasted the shock
with great courage, declared his innocence,
and asked only for time and opportunity
to clear up the whole transaction;
but the judgment of the court was
against him, and public opinion went
with it. His popularity vanished at
once; his friends deserted him, and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
creditors coming upon him, he was unable
to pay them, and was consequently
thrown into prison.</p>

<p>“Here he remained for two years,
during which period his wife died, leaving
a daughter, who has since remained
with her grandfather, M. Scager, and is
now grown up to be a beautiful black-eyed
girl.”</p>

<p>At this point of Mr. Hartley’s story,
my mind turned back to the place where
I spent the first night after my departure
from Paramaribo, and it seemed to me
probable that the girl whom I had seen
there was my cousin. I therefore interrupted
the narrative, and said, “Allow
me to inquire, sir, where the girl you
speak of now lives.” “With her grandfather,”
was the reply, “about ten miles
from Paramaribo.” “Then I have seen
her,” said I. “Indeed,” said the Englishman,
“and how did that happen?”</p>

<p>I then related my adventures at the
plantation, giving a brief account of
my fright at the bat, the hospitality with
which I was treated, and the interest that
had been excited in the black-eyed girl
on learning my name. When I had
done, Mr. Hartley proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>It is a strange accident that should
have brought you into an acquaintance
with your cousin Mirabel. However, to
proceed with your uncle’s story. As he
continued in prison, no opportunity was
afforded for him even to make an attempt
to clear up his character. His name,
therefore, passed into contempt and infamy.
M. Scager, who was a proud and
haughty man, was sorely mortified at
the disgrace which had fallen upon his
family, through the connection, and
would permit no one even to speak of his
son-in-law.</p>

<p>“Time passed on, and the subject was
nearly forgotten. Your uncle seemed as
completely lost to the world as if he had
been dead and buried; but at length a
considerable excitement was produced by
the rumor that he had escaped from prison.
On inquiry, it was found that he
was gone, but no one could tell how he
had effected his liberation, nor whither
he had fled. This occurred about a dozen
years ago. It excited no little curiosity
at the time, and various rumors were
afloat respecting it.</p>

<p>“There were a few persons who had
always entertained the belief that your
uncle was the victim of a foul conspiracy
between the insurance company and
the captain of the ship; that the loss of
the vessel was unavoidable; and that, in
order to save the immense sum for which
insurance had been effected, the captain
had been bribed to make oath to a false
statement. But these rumors gradually
subsided, and for the space of nearly a
dozen years, your uncle’s name was
hardly mentioned.</p>

<p>“But about a twelve-month ago there
was occasion for new surprise. I had
known your uncle intimately, for during
his residence in Paramaribo, I also lived
there. I had the greatest confidence in
him, and loved him as if he had been my
brother. I never fully credited the
charges that were brought against him,
and therefore made some efforts in his behalf
during his imprisonment, but it became
necessary for me to establish myself
here, and I was able to render him
no effectual assistance. I had no communication
from him after I left Paramaribo,
and had no better means of judging
whither he had gone than any other individual.
His escape, however, seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
be an argument against him, and as
nothing was heard from him, my mind
gradually yielded to the conviction that
he had been guilty of the crime with
which he was charged.</p>

<p>“But about a year ago, I was astonished
as well as delighted to receive from
Amsterdam a remittance amounting to
sixty thousand dollars, with directions to
pay your uncle’s creditors the full amount
due to them, both principal and interest.
No explanations whatever were given;
no clue was afforded as to the source
from which the money came. I proceeded
to distribute it according to the
directions, and paid every one of the persons
to whom your uncle was indebted,
and had still a balance of about two thousand
dollars in my hands. I have written
to the persons at Amsterdam, through
whom the money came to me, making
inquiries as to your uncle, and
asking instructions respecting the surplus
that remains, and have had only the
naked reply, that no knowledge whatever
of your uncle is in possession of the
parties, and that they have no directions
but those given me in the first letter.</p>

<p>“I have not been able to obtain any
precise information respecting your uncle.
Upon the payment of his debts, an
entire revolution of public opinion took
place at Paramaribo, in regard to him.
The belief became general that he was
what he seemed to be, a high-minded and
honorable man, and that he had suffered
from a base conspiracy. The uneasiness
displayed by a certain lawyer who had
been connected with the insurance company,
served to confirm these opinions.</p>

<p>“There was also another circumstance
which contributed to the same result, and
this was, that the captain had never returned
to Paramaribo, although he had a
wife and family there; and it was reported
that he had turned out a desperate
character, and had been engaged in several
piratical expeditions.”</p>

<p>It may be well believed that I listened
to this recital with the most intense interest.
Scarcely was it finished, when
my determination was formed to set
about a search for my uncle. I soon
communicated these views to Mr. Hartley.
At first he objected, urging my
youth, the utter want of a clue by which
he could be traced, and my destitution of
means for sustaining the expense of the
undertaking, as conclusive arguments
against it.</p>

<p>He considered the project indeed to be
the hair-brained dream of a sanguine
boy; but as I persisted in my resolution,
and suggested my plan of operation, he
began to listen, and in the end, gave me
his hearty support and efficient aid. He
supplied me with letters to several persons
in Paramaribo, who might aid me in
my researches, furnished me with money
for my immediate expenses, and gave
me a letter of credit for what I might farther
need. Being thus provided, I soon
set out for Paramaribo, with high hopes
of success in my proposed search.</p>

<p class="center small">(Continued from page 95.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> English, driven by these successes
from their entrenchments, lost, with
their spirit of confidence, more than
six thousand men. Joan was once
more received by the city as a delivering
angel; skepticism itself yielded to these
prodigies; the French, as if inspired by
a celestial energy, passed from despair to
a sanguine enthusiasm, before which obstacles
melted away as mists in the sun’s
ray.</p>

<p>The English generals, surprised and
dismayed, sought to combat fanaticism
with its own weapons, by attributing
their discomfiture to the ascendancy of
malignant demons, of whom they gravely
declared the maid to be the implement.
To discover and weigh the operation of
motives on the human mind, was an effort
too arduous for an unenlightened age.
The doctrine of demons did little towards
raising the drooping spirits of the besiegers,
who sagely concluded a contest with
superior powers, whether of light or darkness,
to be unequal and hopeless. Unable
to maintain his ground with a panic-struck
army, Suffolk prudently raised the
siege, May 8th, 1429, and retreated.</p>

<p>The French, determined to pursue
their advantage, allowed the enemy no
time to rally; a body of six thousand
men were deputed by the Dauphin to attack
the English at Jergean, where a detachment
had retired with Suffolk. The
place was obstinately defended during a
siege of ten days. Joan, in leading the
attack, descended rapidly into the fosse,
where she received a blow on the head
from a stone, which stunned her and threw
her down; but quickly recovering herself,
the assault was carried, and Suffolk
was compelled to yield himself a prisoner.
The remains of the English army,
solicitous only to effect a retreat,
sought for a place of safety; while the
vanguard of the French, attacking their
rear, at the village of Patay, they were
wholly routed; two thousand men fell
in the action, and two of their generals
were taken prisoners. The conduct of
the troops, the military operations, and
even the decisions of the council, were
poetically attributed to Joan, to whose
sagacity and promptitude, in availing
herself of the suggestions of more experienced
commanders, no mean praise is
due.</p>

<p>Having performed a part of her mission
in raising the siege of Orleans, the
crowning of Charles at Rheims only remained
to be effected, on which enterprise
she now insisted. Rheims, situated
in a distant part of the kingdom, was
still in the hands of the enemy, whose
garrisons occupied the road which led to
it; the idea of passing them would, a
few weeks before, have been deemed
rash and impracticable; but the spirit
which now animated the French made
them invincible.</p>

<p>To avail himself of the enthusiasm of
his troops, and the consternation of the
English, for which the belief of a supernatural
agency afforded but a delicate
and critical support, was undoubtedly the
interest of Charles; persuaded by his
friends that the safety of the state depended
on his person, he had hitherto
restrained his military ardor; he now
placed himself at the head of his troops,
and under the auspices of Heaven and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
fortune, inspired new zeal into his adherents.
At the head of twelve thousand
men he began his career. Troye opened
to him its gates; Chalons followed
the example, while, before his approach,
Rheims sent him a deputation with its
keys; every obstacle thus overcome, the
ceremony of the coronation was performed,
July 17th, with the holy oil, brought
from heaven by a pigeon to Clovis, on
the first establishment of the French
monarchy.</p>

<p>The maid, clothed in armor, and displaying
her sacred and victorious banner,
took her place, on this occasion, by the
side of the king; while the people hailed
this combination of miracles with shouts
and acclamations, Joan, after the ceremony
was completed, throwing herself at
the feet of the monarch, embraced his
knees, and, shedding tears of tenderness
and joy, congratulated him and herself
on the success of her mission.</p>

<p>The mystical inauguration of Charles
shed over him a kind of glory, and gave
him in the eyes of the nation new and
divine rights; triumph and success, the
best proofs of inspiration, by flattering
the inclination of the people, gave support
and stability to their faith; no one
presumed to doubt that, in all that had
passed, the finger of Heaven was evident
and clear.</p>

<p>Lyons, Soissons, Chateau-Thierre, Provins,
with various other towns and fortresses,
submitted to the summons of the
king and that of the prophetic maid;
while the whole country disposed itself
to testify its loyalty and zeal. A medal
was struck in honor of the heroine, bearing
on one side her portrait; on the
other, a hand grasping a sword, with this
motto, “<cite lang="la">Consilio confirmata Dei</cite>,”—“<cite>Sustained
by the hand of God</cite>.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, firm, vigilant,
and resolute, still preserved his footing in
France, where he employed every resource
which circumstances had yet left
to him; his garrisons were held in postures
of defence, and a watchful eye kept
over the French; while the Parisians
were, by alternate severity and caresses,
yet retained in the English interest. An
alliance with the Duke of Burgundy, the
most important to their sinking credit,
was, at the same time renewed and
strengthened. The supplies of money
from the British parliament were tardy
and scanty; while the impression produced
on the minds of the troops of the
wonderful power and resources of the
maid, occasioned daily desertions in the
army.</p>

<p>In this perilous state of their affairs,
their spirits were revived by the arrival
of Cardinal Winchester, who landed at
Calais, with a body of five thousand men,
which had been levied originally for a
crusade. The Cardinal suffered himself
to be prevailed upon by the Duke of
Bedford to lend hire these troops, for the
purpose of opposing the French king,
who with his forces was advancing towards
Paris.</p>

<p>Charles, having left Rheims, and taken
St. Denis and Lagni, proceeded to the
capital, to which he laid siege. The
barriers of the port of St. Honoré were
forced, when Joan, flushed with military
ardor, and animated by success, in attempting
to pass the fosse, received a
wound in her thigh. Pressing forward,
regardless of the blood which streamed
through her armor, she was at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
perceived by the Duke of Alençon, who
observing her situation, carried her forcibly
back to the camp. The king was,
however, compelled, by want of provisions,
to raise the siege, and to retreat
from before Paris with his troops.</p>

<p>The mission of the maid having been
thus accomplished, she expressed a wish
to be allowed to retire; but this request
was overruled. Charles, still solicitous
to retain her in his service, conferred, as
a testimony of his gratitude, nobility upon
her family and their posterity, both in the
male and female line. Armorial bearings
were accordingly assigned to her, and her
name was changed from Arc to Lys.
Domremi, the city which gave her birth,
received at the same time a perpetual exemption
from subsidies and taxes.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, prudently declining
a present engagement with a victorious
foe, chose his posts with wisdom
and caution, attended the French in all
their movements, covered the towns and
garrisons which remained in his possession,
and attentively watched the steps of
the enemy. The French army, consisting
mostly of volunteers, were soon after
disbanded. The king, having made himself
master of various towns in the neighborhood
of Paris, retired to Bourges, the
place of his ordinary residence.</p>

<p>The Duke of Bedford, with the hope of
reviving the courage of the troops, proposed
that the young king of England
should pass over to France, be crowned
at Paris, and receive from his vassals a
new oath of allegiance. This ceremony,
however, politically planned, afforded but
a spiritless spectacle, when compared
with the coronation at Rheims. But an
event soon after took place, which gave
a different aspect to affairs, while it reflected
upon both nations lasting dishonor.</p>

<p>The English, supported by the Duke
of Burgundy, laid siege to the town of
Compéigne, into which Joan threw herself.
The garrison, who, with her assistance,
believed themselves invincible, received
her with transports of joy. On
the day following her arrival, May 24th,
1430, she headed a sally made on the
quarters of John de Luxemberg. Having
thrice driven the enemy from their
intrenchments, and finding their numbers
increasing every moment, she prudently
ordered a retreat. But the pursuers
pressing hard upon her, she turned
upon them and forced them to recoil.
The besieged, protected in the rear by
Joan, had in the mean time gained the
city in safety, the gates of which were
instantly closed. Joan, thus deserted
and alone, perceiving herself excluded,
surrounded by the enemy, suspecting
treachery, and rendered desperate, exerted
herself with a courage, deserving a better
fate. Her horse at length falling under
her, she was compelled, after performing
prodigies of valor, to surrender
to the enemy. The Burgundians, into
whose hands she had fallen, carried their
prisoner to Luxemburg, where, for ten
thousand livres, they basely sold her to
the English. It is believed that the
French officers, jealous of the glory of
the maid, had designedly exposed her to
this fatal catastrophe. Such is human
gratitude and the fate of merit, and such
the recompense awarded to the benefactors
of their species.</p>

<p>The savage triumph of her enemies
on her capture, was the unequivocal eulogium
of the heroine. <i lang="la">Te Deum</i>, a service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
so often profaned, was celebrated at
Paris on the event. The courage of the
English, blasted by the successes of Joan,
began, on her imprisonment, to revive.
The Duke of Bedford, instigated by a
policy alike barbarous and disgraceful,
commenced a prosecution against his
magnanimous captive, who, by the circumstances
of her defeat, the gallantry of
her conduct, and her irreproachable life,
was justly entitled to the privileges of a
prisoner of war. Her youth, her sex,
whose appropriate decorum she had
strictly observed, her extraordinary qualities,
added to the services she had performed
for her country, gave her novel
and singular claims, to which fanaticism
alone could have remained insensible.
Under the sanction of religion, justice
was outraged and humanity violated.</p>

<p>A petition against the maid was presented
by the Bishop of Beauvais, who
was devoted to the cause of the English,
under the pretence that she was taken
within the bounds of his diocese, he requested
that she might be delivered over
to the ecclesiastical court, to be tried for
sorcery, impiety, and magic. The University
of Paris covered itself with infamy,
by joining in this petition. The title
of <cite>Inquisitor of the Faith</cite> was assumed
on the occasion by the Bishop of Beauvais.</p>

<p>The court was held at Rouen, where
the young king of England then resided,
and where Joan, loaded with irons, and
clothed in her military apparel, was produced
before this prejudiced tribunal.
She had previously endeavored to procure
her liberty by leaping from the top
of the tower in which she was confined;
but, stunned by the fall, had been discovered
by the sentinel, and retaken. An
accusation of intending suicide, was, on
this justifiable attempt, added to the offences
with which the prisoner was
charged. Having requested of her judges
to be eased from her chains, she was reproached
with her design of escaping.
She boldly avowed and justified the fact,
declaring at the same time, that if she
hesitated to repeat her attempt, it was
only from despair of success. Throughout
her trial, she discovered equal firmness
and courage. Being interrogated
respecting the affairs of the court of
France, she refused to reply to the questions
made to her, alleging that where
the secrets of the king were concerned,
she owed no obedience to the ecclesiastical
powers.</p>

<p>Nearly four months she was continually
harassed by questions and persecutions
the most ridiculous and absurd.
Her enemies termed her a “sorceress
and a heretic.” The assembled
university, having pronounced her a
schismatic, proceeded to threaten her
with the stake. She was repeatedly examined
respecting her visions, revelations,
and intercourse with departed saints,
and required to submit to the church the
truth of her inspirations. “To God,”
she replied, “the fountain of truth, I am
willing to submit them.” By this answer,
she drew upon herself the charge
of denying the authority of the church.
She appealed from her judges to the
Pope, but her appeal was fruitless.</p>

<p>It was demanded whether she had not
put her trust in a standard consecrated
by magical incantations? Whether, at
the coronation of Charles, she had not
still displayed this mysterious standard?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
“Her trust,” she replied, “was in the
image of the Almighty impressed on the
banner, and that she, who had shared the
danger of the field, was entitled to partake
of the glory at Rheims.” Accused
of violating the decorums of her sex, by
assuming the habits and command over
men, she boldly avowed and justified the
purpose of this violation—“the defeat of
the enemies of her country, and their expulsion
from the kingdom.” During
these examinations, she betrayed no
weakness, nor gave to her persecutors
any advantage; she disgraced not, when
in the power of her determined adversaries,
the heroism she had displayed in
the field.</p>

<p>Every species of imposition and baseness
was practised upon her; she was
required to abjure the masculine habit,
and a paper for this purpose was tendered
her to sign, to which a promise was
subjoined never more to bear arms. Having
complied with this proposition, a new
deed was substituted in its place, in which
she was made to criminate herself by the
most odious and false imputations. The
malice of her enemies, aggravated by superstition,
led them to accuse her of various
crimes, particularly of a compact
made with infernal spirits. After having
received judgment, she was delivered
over for sentence to the secular arm.</p>

<p>Harassed by injustice, exhausted by
suffering, and subdued by cruelty, the
spirit of Joan at length gave way; browbeaten
by men of superior rank, condemned
by those whose injunctions she
had been accustomed to regard as sacred,
basely deserted by the monarch she had
served, sustained no longer by applause
and success, her enthusiasm began to
subside; the dreams of inspiration were
superseded by the feelings of nature,
while before the terrors of impending
death, the visions of a distempered fancy
faded away. Recanting, she acknowledged
that she had been misled by illusions;
which she solemnly engaged
henceforward to renounce, and prayed
to be reconciled to the bosom of the
church. In consequence of this humiliation,
her sentence was mitigated to perpetual
imprisonment.</p>

<p>No steps were taken by Charles to
rescue from destruction the deliverer of
himself and the saviour of his dominions;
nor, while he held in his hands, as prisoners
of war, English of the first distinction,
were any proposals offered to
exchange them for the heroic Joan:—a
memorable example of the gratitude of
princes.</p>

<p>Political vengeance might here have
ceased; but the malignity of the adversaries
of the unfortunate Joan, was not
yet fully glutted—barbarous and insatiable,
they thirsted for her blood! Having
consented to abjure the masculine
habit, and to assume the habits and attire
of her sex, it was determined to
tempt her to a violation of her engagement.
For that purpose a suit of men’s
apparel was placed in her room, and
spies were appointed to observe her conduct.
Whether the sight of a dress associated
with so many flattering, so many
glorious ideas, induced her to re-assume
it, or whether, as has been alleged, her
own clothes were removed while she
slept, and were designedly withheld
from her, is of little moment; certain it
is, that she was tempted in the solitude
of her prison, to array herself in the forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
garb. Seized by her treacherous
enemies in this situation, and declared
guilty of a relapse into heresy, she was
excommunicated, and all pardon, and all
mercy refused to her. Crowned with a
paper, on which was inscribed the terms
“apostate, heretic, and idolatress,” and
guarded by armed soldiers, she was soon
after delivered over to the stake, which
had been erected for the purpose in the
market-place of Rouen.</p>

<p>On the right hand of the scaffold, on
which she was exposed to the savage
fury of the people, were stationed the
clergy, and on the left, the secular officers.
In this situation, she was with
solemn mockery, interrogated on the
principles of her faith; principles, which
in no respect appeared to differ from those
of her merciless persecutors. A discourse
was pronounced by Nicholas Midi,
towards the conclusion of the ceremony,
in which the poor culprit was informed
that “the meek and merciful ministers
of the Gospel had, for the execution of
their sentence, consigned her over to the
secular powers.”</p>

<p>The bailli of Rouen, less firm than the
preacher, could only say, “Let it be.”
The tears of Joan even softened the executioner,
while the theologians, incapable
of the weakness of humanity, remained
firm and unmoved. “<i lang="fr">Dieu soit bene!</i>”—“Blessed
be God!” exclaimed the sufferer,
as she placed herself upon the pile.
Her body was quickly consumed, and
her ashes were scattered to the winds.
Thus perished this admirable woman,
June 14, 1431, to whom “the more liberal
and generous superstition of the ancients
would have erected altars.” Thus
were the services rendered by Joan to her
ungrateful prince and country ultimately
rewarded.</p>

<p>The following character of the maid
of Orleans, from Fuller, is to be found
in the preface to Mr. Southey’s Joan of
Arc. “People found out a nest of miracles
in her education, that so lion-like a
spirit should be bred among sheep like
David. Even after she went in man’s
clothing, being armed cap-a-pie, and
mounted on a brave steed; and which was
a wonder, when she was on horseback,
none was more bold and daring; when
alighted, none more tame and meek; so
that one could scarce see her for herself,
she was so changed and altered, as if
her spirits dismounted with her body.”</p>

<p>Some years after her decease, Joan
was, by a bull of Pope Calixtus III., declared
a martyr to her religion, her country,
and her king. She is made by
Chapelain the subject of a French epic
poem, entitled <cite>La Pucelle</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"> A Blacksmith’s Shop in the West.</span>—Some
years ago a man was travelling in
the western country, when one of his
horse’s shoes being loose, he inquired of
a person he met in the woods, if there
was a blacksmith in those parts. “Yes,
stranger,” was the reply. “Will you direct
me to his shop?” said the traveller.
“You are in it now!” said the other.
“In it now!” said the stranger; “but my
friend—without joking—where shall I
find the blacksmith?” “Four miles off,”
was the reply. “I do not understand
you,” said the horseman. “Well, stranger,”
said the woodsman, “I will tell you
all about it. The blacksmith’s shop is
all out of doors, but his anvil is at the
cross road, four miles ahead.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The American Panther.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> animal has as many names as
any other felon that ever figured in
history. He is called the “American
Lion,” the “American Panther,” the
“Puma,” the “Cougar,” the “Catamount,”
and the “Painter.” The real
fact is, that he is a creature peculiar to
this continent, and is neither a lion, nor
a panther, nor anything indeed, but himself—an
independent member of the
great family of cats, roaming over the
woods of both North and South America,
and always doing business on his own
hook. He is a creature of great strength,
being able to carry off a sheep or deer
at a gallop; but he prefers rather to
live by his wit than his power. He always
creeps upon his victim with a sly
and noiseless step, and when at a proper
distance, rushes upon it with a bound,
and grapples it with his formidable
claws and teeth.</p>

<p>The panther was once common in
New England, but he does not like
meeting-houses and taverns, so he has
emigrated westward. The traveller in
the western wilds will often hear a noise
that seems like the wailing of a child;
but after a little examination, he will
find it to proceed from a reddish gray
animal in the top of a tree, looking down
at him with anxious eyes, and seeming
to say, “If it’s all the same to you, I
should like to make a supper of you or
your horse.”</p>

<p>A great many adventures have taken
place with this creature in the woods.
Here are some of the stories told of it.</p>

<p>“Two hunters, accompanied by two
dogs, went out in quest of game near
the Catskill mountains. At the foot of
a large hill, they agreed to go round it
in opposite directions, and when either
discharged his rifle, the other was to
hasten towards him to aid in securing
the game. Soon after parting, the report
of a rifle was heard by one of them,
who, hastening towards the spot, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
some search, found nothing but the dog,
dreadfully lacerated and dead. He now
became much alarmed for the fate of his
companion, and while anxiously looking
around, was horror-struck by the harsh
growl of a Cougar, which he perceived
on a large limb of a tree, crouching upon
the body of his friend, and apparently
meditating an attack on himself. Instantly
he levelled his rifle at the beast,
and was so fortunate as to wound it mortally,
when it fell to the ground along
with the body of his slaughtered companion.
His dog then rushed upon the
wounded Cougar, which with one blow
of its paw laid the poor animal dead by
its side. The surviving hunter now left
the spot, and quickly returned with several
other persons, when they found the
lifeless Cougar extended near the dead
bodies of the hunter and the faithful
dogs.”</p>

<p>“About the close of the last war, a
merchant of Piqua, named Herse, received
a considerable sum of money in small
bills, which made it appear of still greater
magnitude to several suspicious looking
persons who were present when it
was received. Mr. Herse, being unarmed,
was apprehensive that an attempt
would be made to rob him at the camping
ground, and expressed his apprehensions
to a single fellow-traveller, who
was also unprovided with arms. In consequence,
they resolved not to go to the
camping ground, but to pass the night
in the woods without fire; there, turning
their horses loose, they lay down in their
blankets on the leaves. In the night
they were aroused by hearing the horses
snort as they are apt to do on the approach
of Indians, and shortly after they
were heard to make several bounds
through the woods, as if some one had
unsuccessfully attempted to catch them.</p>

<p>“After some time had elapsed, they
both distinctly heard what they supposed
to be a man crawling towards them on his
hands and feet, as they could hear first
one hand cautiously extended and pressed
very gently on the leaves to avoid
making a noise, then the other, and
finally the other limbs in like manner
and with equal care. When they believed
that this felonious visitor was
within about ten feet of them, they
touched each other, sprang up simultaneously,
and rushed to some distance
through the woods, where they crouched
and remained without further disturbance.
A short time after they heard the
horses snorting and bounding furiously
through the woods, but they did not venture
to arise until broad daylight, being
still ignorant of the character of their
enemy.</p>

<p>“When sufficiently light to see, by
climbing a sapling they discovered the
horses at a considerable distance on the
prairie. On approaching them, it was
at once evident that their disturber had
been nothing less than a Cougar. It
had sprung upon the horses, and so lacerated
with its claws and teeth their flanks
and buttocks, that with the greatest difficulty
were they able to drive the poor
creatures before them to Shane’s. Several
other instances of annoyance to
travellers had happened at the same
place, and Shane believed by the same
Cougar.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ferocious disposition
and bad reputation of the panther
in his wild and natural state, he can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
taught better manners, and it is by no
means uncommon to see them around
the houses in South America, quite gentle
and well-behaved—a fact which strikingly
displays the power of education.
I have known boys almost as wild as
panthers, rendered tame and dutiful by
a little birch and a great deal of kindness.
Recommending this moral to
schoolmasters, parents, and guardians,
we bid good-bye to the panther, only
adding that the history of great rascals
may sometimes teach us a good lesson.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Lovewell’s War.</h3>

<p class="center small">(Continued from page 76.)</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">roops</span> were raised and enlisted for
two years’ service, and the government
had no scruples in offering
a bounty of forty pounds sterling for
every Indian scalp. This war obtained
the name of “Lovewell’s War,” from
Captain John Lovewell, of Dunstable, in
New Hampshire, who was the most prominent
commander in the enterprise against
the enemy, and was killed in a severe
engagement. Various incursions were
made upon the settlements by the Indians
during the year 1723, and several of the
inhabitants were killed and carried into
captivity. On the 10th of June, 1724, a
farmer and his son, being at work on
Oyster River, planting corn, went to a
brook to drink, and discovered three Indian
packs. They immediately ran to give
information to a company of volunteers,
which had lately been raised in the neighborhood,
for the defence of the frontier.
The company marched towards the spot,
but were fired upon from an ambush, and
the farmer and his son, who acted as
guides, were both killed. The company
then fired and killed one of the Indians,
and wounded two others who made their
escape, though they were pursued and
tracked by their blood to a considerable
distance. The slain Indian was a person
of distinction, and wore a species of
coronet, made of fur, dyed scarlet, with
an appendage of four small bells, by the
sound of which the others might follow
him through the thickets. His hair, contrary
to what is almost universal among
the natives, was remarkably soft and
fine; and he had about him a devotional
book, and a muster-roll of one hundred
and eighty Indians. From these various
circumstances, it was supposed that he
was a natural son of the Jesuit, Rasle, by
an Indian woman, who served him as a
domestic.</p>

<p>Garrison-houses were built among the
frontier settlements, to which the inhabitants
were warned to repair in time of
danger. At Dover there were many
families of Quakers, who, doubting the
lawfulness of war, could not be persuaded
to use any means for their defence, although
the Indians never spared them
on that account. One of these, John
Hanson, lived remote from the garrison,
and refused to take shelter in it with his
family, although he had a large number
of children. A party of thirteen Indians,
called French Mohawks, had marked
his house for their prey, and lay several
days in ambush, waiting for an opportunity
to attack it. On the 27th of June,
while Hanson and his eldest daughter
were gone to attend the weekly meeting,
and his two eldest sons were at work in
a meadow at some distance, the Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
entered the house, killed and scalped two
small children, and took his wife, with her
infant of fourteen days old, her nurse, two
daughters, and a son, and, after rifling
the house, carried them off. This was
done so suddenly and secretly, that the
first person who discovered it was the
eldest daughter, on her return from the
meeting. Seeing the two children dead
at the door, she uttered a shriek of distress,
which was distinctly heard by her
mother, then in the hands of the enemy
among the bushes, and by her brothers in
the meadow. The people, being soon
alarmed, went in pursuit of the enemy;
but the Indians, cautiously avoiding all
beaten paths, went off with their captives
undiscovered. The mother, though of a
tender constitution, had a firm and vigorous
mind, and passed through the various
hardships of an Indian captivity with
much resolution and patience. When
her milk failed, she supported her infant
with water warmed in her mouth, till the
squaws taught her to beat the kernel of
walnuts and boil it with bruised corn,
which proved a nourishing food for the
babe. The prisoners were all sold to the
French in Canada. Hanson redeemed
them the following year, one daughter
remaining behind.</p>

<p>These and other outrages of the enemy
caused the government of Massachusetts
to resolve on an expedition against
the Indian town of Norridgewock. Two
hundred men, under Captains Moulton
and Harmon, marched from York in August.
They left forty of their men at Teconic
Falls, on the Kennebec, and, dividing
the remainder into two bodies, one of
them, under Harmon, took a circuitous
route, hoping to surprise some of the enemy
in their cornfields, while the other,
under Moulton, marched directly for the
village of Norridgewock, which, being
surrounded by trees, could not be seen till
they were close upon it. All the Indians
were in their wigwams, and the English
advanced cautiously and in perfect silence.
When they had approached very
near, an Indian came out of his wigwam,
and, discovering the English, set up the
war-whoop, ran in, and seized his gun. In
a few minutes the warriors were all in
arms, and advanced to meet them. Moulton
gave orders not to fire till the Indians
had made their first discharge. This was
done, and, as he expected, they overshot
the English, who then immediately fired
with great execution. After another volley
had been exchanged, the savages
fled with precipitation to the river. They
were pursued and slaughtered in every
quarter, and their wigwams set on fire.
Moulton wished to take Rasle alive, and
gave strict orders that no one should kill
him. But the Jesuit having shut himself
up in his house, from which he continued
to fire upon the English, one of them
burst into it, and shot him through the
head. They then set fire to the church,
which was a handsome structure, and
brought away the plate and furniture of
the altar, with the devotional banner,
as trophies of their victory. Eighty of
the Indians were killed in this attack, and
three English captives rescued.</p>

<p>The fate of Norridgewock struck
great terror into the savages, and they
no longer thought themselves safe at
any of their former places of abode,
but occupied them as resting-places only,
when they were scouting or hunting.
This successful undertaking, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
large premium offered for scalps, brought
several volunteer companies into the field.
In December, Captain Lovewell, with
thirty men, made an excursion to the
north of Lake Winnipiseogee. They
discovered an Indian wigwam, in which
were a man and a boy. They killed
and scalped the man, and brought the boy
alive to Boston, where they received the
reward promised by the government, and a
considerable gratuity besides. This company
was soon increased to seventy, and
Lovewell marched again, early in 1725,
toward the head of Salmon-Fall River.
Their provision falling short, thirty of
them, selected by lot, were dismissed, and
returned home. The remaining forty
continued their march till the 20th of
February, when they discovered a track,
which they followed till they saw a
smoke, just before sunset; from this they
judged that the enemy were encamped
for the night. They kept themselves concealed
till after midnight, when they cautiously
advanced, and discovered ten Indians
asleep round a fire, by the side of
a frozen pond. Lovewell now determined
to make sure work, and, stationing
his men conveniently, ordered five of
them to fire in rapid succession, and the
remainder to reserve their shot. He
gave the signal by discharging his own
gun, which killed two Indians; and the
men, firing according to order, despatched
five more on the spot. The remaining
three started up from their sleep, but two
of them were immediately shot dead by
the reserve, and the other was wounded.
He attempted to escape across the pond,
but was seized by a dog, who held him
fast until the English came up and dispatched
him. Thus, in the space of a few
minutes, the whole party was destroyed,
and an attempt against the frontiers of
New Hampshire prevented;—for these
Indians were marching from Canada, well
furnished with new guns and plenty of
ammunition for that object; they had also
a number of spare blankets, moccasons,
and snow-shoes, for the use of the prisoners
whom they expected to take. The
pond near which these events transpired
is now known as Lovewell’s Pond. The
company, with their ten scalps stretched
on hoops, in the Indian fashion, marched
to Boston in great triumph, and received
their bounty out of the public treasury.
The English spoke of this enterprise
with great exultation, and pronounced it
a capital exploit. In the light of the
present day, the barbarity of giving a
premium for scalps would be justly censured.</p>

<p>This brilliant success, as it was then
termed, encouraged Lovewell to his last
and fatal undertaking. Early in March,
he again took the field, intending to
attack the Indian villages of Piguacket,
on the upper part of the Saco, where a
formidable tribe anciently had a settled
habitation, though at this period they
only paid occasional visits there. His
company consisted of forty-six men, including
a chaplain and a surgeon. Two
of them became lame, and returned.
Another falling sick, they halted, and
built a stockade fort on the west side of
Great Ossipee Lake, partly for the accommodation
of the sick man, and partly
for a stronghold in case of any reverse.
Here the surgeon was left with
the invalid and eight of the company
for a guard. Lovewell, with his
thirty-four men, advanced to the northward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
about twenty-two miles, and encamped
on the shore of a pond in the
evening of the 7th of May. Early the
next morning, while the men were at
prayer, they heard the report of a gun,
and discovered an Indian about a mile
distant, standing on a point of land jutting
out into the water. They had been
alarmed during the night by noises
round their camp, which they imagined
were made by Indians, and now suspected
that the one whom they saw was
placed there to decoy them, and that a
body of the enemy was in their front.
A council of war was held, and they decided
to go forward, and, by marching
round the pond, to gain the spot where
the Indian stood. That they might be
ready for action, they disencumbered
themselves of their packs, and left them,
without any guard, in a pine plain, where
the trees were too thinly set to hide them.</p>

<p>Lovewell, on his march, had crossed
a carrying-place, by which two parties of
Indians, consisting of forty-one warriors,
commanded by the noted chiefs Paugus
and Wahwa, who had been on a scout
down the Saco, were returning to the
lower village of Piguacket, about a mile
and a half from the pond. Having fallen
on Lovewell’s track, they followed it,
and came at last to the baggage, which
they carried off. On counting the packs,
they found the number of the English to
be less than that of their own force. They
therefore placed themselves in ambush to
attack them on their return. The Indian
who had stood on the point, and was
turning to the village by another path,
met the English and received their fire,
which he returned, and wounded Lovewell
and another person with small shot.
By a second fire the Indian was killed,
and they took his scalp. Seeing no
other enemy, the company returned toward
their packs, and, while they were
searching for them, the Indians sprang
from their ambush and ran towards them
with a horrid yell. A smart firing commenced
on both sides, and Lovewell was
speedily slain, with eight others. Several
of the Indians fell, but, being superior
in numbers, they were by no
means daunted, and endeavored to surround
the English, who, perceiving their
design, retreated, hoping to gain a shelter
behind a point of rocks and some large
pine-trees on the shore of the pond.
Here they took their station, having on
their right the mouth of a brook, and on
their left the rocky point,—their front being
partly covered by a deep bog, with
the pond in the rear.</p>

<p>The battle now recommenced. The
Indians poured in their fire from front
and flank, and had so much the advantage
of position, that, by a little skill,
they might have shot down every man
of the English, or compelled them to
surrender at discretion, as they were totally
unable to extricate themselves, and
were entirely destitute of provisions.
Under the conduct of Lieutenant Wyman,
the latter kept up their fire, and
maintained a resolute countenance the
remainder of the day,—the action having
begun a little after ten in the morning.
The chaplain and three others
were mortally wounded. The Indians
invited them to surrender by holding up
ropes to them, and endeavored to intimidate
them by hideous yells; but they
determined to die rather than to yield,
and, by their well-directed fire, the number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of the savages was reduced, and their
cries became fainter, till, just before night,
they quitted their advantageous ground,
carrying off their killed and wounded,
and leaving the dead bodies of Lovewell
and his men unscalped. The shattered
remnants of this brave company, on coming
together, found three of their number
unable to move from the spot, eleven
wounded, but able to march, and nine
unhurt. It was melancholy to leave
their dying companions behind, but there
was no possibility of removing them.
One of these, Ensign Robbins, desired
them to lay his gun beside him loaded,
that, if the Indians should return before
his death, he might be able to kill one
more.</p>

<p>After the rising of the moon, those who
were able quitted the fatal spot, and
directed their march toward the fort
where the surgeon and guard had been
left. To their great surprise, they found
it abandoned. In the beginning of the
action, one man had deserted and fled
to the fort, where, in the style of Job’s
messengers, he informed them of Lovewell’s
death and the defeat of the whole
company, upon which they made the
best of their way home, leaving a quantity
of provisions, which proved a seasonable
relief to the retreating survivors.
From this place they endeavored to get
home. Lieutenant Farwell, and the chaplain,
who had the journal of the march in
his pocket, and one other, perished in the
woods, for want of a dressing for their
wounds. The others, after enduring the
most severe hardships, reached the settlements,
one after another. There were
no white residents within fifty miles of
the scene of the battle.</p>

<p>A party from the New Hampshire
frontier was ordered out to bury the
dead. Fourteen bodies were found,
which were interred, and their names
carved on the trees. Three Indian
graves were discovered and opened; one
of them contained the body of the warrior-chief,
Paugus. Tracks of blood
were traced to a great distance from the
scene of action, but the exact loss of the
enemy never was known. After this
battle, the Indians abandoned the neighborhood
of Piguacket, and did not return
till the war was over.</p>

<p>A doggerel ballad, on the subject of
“Lovewell’s Fight,” made its appearance
the same year that these events
happened, and was for a long time very
popular in New England. As the reader
may wish to see a specimen of it, we
quote the opening stanza, which is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">“Of worthy Captain Lovewell I purpose now to sing,</div>
    <div class="i1">How valiantly he served his country and his king.</div>
    <div class="i1">He and his valiant soldiers did range the woods full wide,</div>
    <div class="i1">And hardships they endured to quell the Indian’s pride.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>We add the sixteenth stanza, as it
notices a striking circumstance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">“Our worthy Captain Lovewell among them there did die.</div>
    <div class="i1">They killed Lieutenant Robbins, and wounded good young Frye,</div>
    <div class="i1">Who was our English chaplain; he many Indians slew,</div>
    <div class="i1">And some of them he scalped, when bullets round him flew.”</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The following winter, four chiefs
came to Boston to ratify the treaty which
followed these hostilities. The government
of the colonies prohibited all private<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
traffic with the Indians, as it had
been the cause of many troubles. Truckhouses
were established in convenient
places, at which they were supplied with
all the necessaries of life on advantageous
terms. Though the government
was a loser by the trade, this was deemed
the most economical method of preserving
peace, and it seems fully to have
accomplished its purpose.</p>

<p>The natives throughout the New England
provinces, now thinned and weakened,
while the English had gained
strength and extended their settlements
in every direction, made no more serious
attempts upon the peace of the country.
In the French wars, even down to the
period just preceding the Revolution, it
is true that incursions were occasionally
made, but they produced no lasting results.</p>

<p>There are few Indians now remaining
in the New England States. A small
number of Mohegans still reside in the
vicinity of Norwich, Connecticut, where
they have a neat little church, and a
missionary has labored among them with
some success. A few Penobscot Indians,
too, are found in Maine, and here and
there, in other places, may be met one
or more of the descendants of the aborigines;
but they are like the last scattered
leaves of autumn,—withered, decaying,
and frozen by the wintry blasts;
spring finds them not again.</p>

<p class="center ls">A GERMAN FABLE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> royal spouse of a powerful ruler
of the East, came to him one day,
weeping with indignation, to seek
revenge against a delinquent and
offender of her majesty. Behold, said
she, the criminal brought me an ornament
of precious stones, but the jewel
proved to be false. He is already atoning
for his deceit in a gloomy cell, but
he shall pay for his wickedness with his
life, I swear it by myself! I demand, O
king, that you condemn him to a contest
with a lion.</p>

<p>Oh, let us not judge in passion, replied
the monarch. For how can indignation
decree justice? It becomes a
prince of the nation to be free from
anger. Is he not the representative and
vicegerent of the Highest?</p>

<p>Does not God express his anger in the
tempest? inquired the queen.</p>

<p>No, replied the king; he displays his
benevolence even in the tempest. Ah,
my beloved, man is too apt to form his
idea of the Eternal from himself.</p>

<p>But the queen’s anger increased, and
she said, God also hates and punishes
the delinquent, and he has not given the
sword to kings without a purpose. I
only ask that justice be done the criminal.
His death has been announced to
him. There is no alternative!</p>

<p>Well, said the king, be it so! To-morrow!</p>

<p>When, on the following day, the hour
arrived, and the drums proclaimed the
bloody spectacle: the queen arose with a
splendid train, and rejoiced in her heart
at the triumph of her indignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
For revenge is like a cooling cordial
to the burning mind.</p>

<p>The herald opened the lists, the delinquent
stood there trembling, and the
drums beat again.</p>

<p>But behold, instead of a lion, came a
white harmless lamb, and familiarly approached
the trembling man. The drums
ceased, and the sweet music of harps and
flutes was heard; and the lamb cringed
at the feet of the victim, and looked
mildly in his face.</p>

<p>Then the eyes of the queen rested on
her spouse, and she blushed. But the
king said, That look, my beloved, is an
evidence to me, that I have exercised the
right of retaliation. He who deceived
you is deceived in return, and to you
will be given the noble instead of the
base! The blush on your cheeks, which
appears to me more beautiful than the
royal purple that adorns you, is also my
reward. For your countenance assures
me that I have acted like the representative
and vicegerent of the Highest!</p>

<p>Then the drums announced the termination
of the spectacle, and the people
cried, All hail, our king and queen!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">Bear and Child.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">L<span class="smcap">eopold</span>, Duke of Lorraine, had a bear
called Marco, of the sagacity and
generosity of which we have the following
remarkable instance. During
the winter of 1709, a Savoyard boy, ready
to perish with cold, in a barn in which
he had been put by a woman with
some more of his companions, thought
proper to enter Marco’s hut, without reflecting
on the danger he incurred in exposing
himself to the mercy of the animal
which occupied it.</p>

<p>Marco, however, instead of doing any
injury to the child, took him between
his paws, and warmed him by pressing
him to his breast, until the next morning,
when he suffered him to depart and ramble
about the city. The boy returned in
the evening to the hut, and was received
with the same affection. For several
days he had no other retreat, and it added
not a little to his joy to perceive that
the bear regularly reserved a part of his
food for him.</p>

<p>A number of days passed in this manner
without the servants knowing anything
of the circumstance. At length,
one day, when one of them came to
bring the bear his supper rather later
than usual, he was astonished to see the
child quietly asleep, clasped in the paws
of the bear. The animal rolled its eyes
in a furious manner, and seemed desirous
that he should make as little noise
as possible, for fear of waking his favorite.
The bear, though ravenous, did not
appear in the least moved by the food
which was placed before him.</p>

<p>The report of this extraordinary circumstance
was soon spread at court, and
reached the ears of Leopold; who, with
some of his courtiers, was desirous of
being satisfied of the truth of Marco’s
generosity. Several of them passed the
night near his hut, and beheld with astonishment
that the bear never stirred so
long as his guest showed any inclination
to sleep. At break of day, the child
awoke, and was very much ashamed to
find himself discovered, and fearing that
he should be punished for his rashness,
begged pardon. The bear, however,
caressed him, and endeavored to prevail
on him to eat what had been brought
him the evening before, which he did at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
the request of the spectators who conducted
him to the prince.</p>

<p>Having learned the whole history of
this singular alliance, and the time which
it had continued, Leopold ordered that
the little Savoyard should be taken care
of; but unhappily the child died a short
time after.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Last Flower of the Season.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">arion</span> and her father were walking in
the fields. It was November, and
the sharp frosts had cut down the
flowers. Even the asters were
withered and perished. But the little
girl came at last to a single blossom that
had survived. It was a small and humble
flower, and it grew upon a barren
spot. But it had found shelter between
the stones, and its very obscurity had
been the means of its protection. The
gaudier blossoms around,—those that
flourished in the richer soil and in more
elevated stations—had fallen before the
breath of approaching winter. Marion
stooped and plucked the little blossom
that seemed to shine like a gem amid the
desolation around, and her father made
this reflection. “See, Marion, how this
blossom has withstood the frost which
has swept down its more stately companions.
It was humble, and therefore
content with a lowly station. This humility
has saved it from destruction. It
is with us, my child, as with the flowers.
The humble and obscure positions of life
are often not only the most quiet, but
also the most safe from the temptations,
sins, and sorrows, which sweep down
those who seek and obtain more ambitious
situations.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">mong</span> the bears that lived in the woods,
there was one that thought himself
very wise. He was, in fact, very
selfish, and cared for nobody but
himself. I am now going to tell you a story,
which will show you how the cunning
beast overreached and ruined himself.</p>

<p>In the country of the bears of which I
am speaking, there were a good many
Indians. These had set a trap so contrived
that if a bear should attempt to get
the bait, a heavy stone would fall upon
his back and crush him.</p>

<p>The bait consisted of a nice leg of venison,
and as one of the bears came that
way, its delicious flavor attracted his attention.
He approached cautiously, and
perceived that the meat was only the bait
of a trap. He went and told what he
had discovered to some of his companions,
and quite a company of bears assembled
to take the subject into consideration.</p>

<p>Among the rest was our cunning bear.
He listened to the various observations of
his friends, and finally, assuming a grave
and honest look, he rose upon his hind
legs, stretched forth his right paw, and
spoke as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“My dear friends, allow me to address
you: this piece of meat is placed here
to tempt you into the trap; be not deceived,
and risk not your lives for a momentary
gratification. What folly would
it be for you, or any other bear, to purchase
pleasure at so high a price. Listen
to the words of wisdom: let us all
depart, and disappoint the schemes of
our deceitful enemies!”</p>

<p>This counsel seemed very wise, and
being uttered with a benignant countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
and an air of great sincerity, made
a deep impression. Accordingly, the
whole troop dispersed, and went their
several ways into the wood.</p>

<p>But the cunning bear had spoken for
others rather than himself. No sooner
was the coast clear, than he turned a
short corner, and went slily back to
the leg of venison. “Now,” said he,
“that I have got rid of my neighbors, I’ll
have a feast all to myself. I’m not
afraid of the trap. I’ve cheated these
Indians many a time. I know how to
slip off the meat without springing the
trap. What fools there are in the world!
These savages catch the deer, and these
silly bears leave it for the wise ones. I
know a thing or two. Fools kill, and the
wise ones eat, the venison.”</p>

<p>With these reflections, our hero stepped
slily into the mouth of the trap. He
put up his nose very gently, and fixed
his teeth in the haunch of venison. He
then gave it a gentle pull, and it was
nearly free, when the trap sprung, and
the enormous stone came down upon
Bruin’s back with a tremendous crash!</p>

<p>The poor beast struggled, and groaned,
and growled terribly, but all in vain.
At last he expired, making this reflection,
“After all, I do not see that we
cunning people are any better off than
anybody else. Soon or late we overreach
ourselves, and perish with the
miserable consciousness that we deserve
our doom.”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Tiger’s Cave.</h3>

<p class="center">AN ADVENTURE AMONG THE MOUNTAINS
OF QUITO.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> leaving the Indian village, we continued
to wind round Chimborazo’s
wide base; but its snow-crowned
head no longer shone above us in
clear brilliancy, for a dense fog was gathering
gradually around it. Our guides
looked anxiously towards it, and announced
their apprehensions of a violent storm.
We soon found that their fears were well
founded. The thunder began to roll,
and resounded through the mountainous
passes with the most terrific grandeur.
Then came the vivid lightning; flash following
flash—above, around, beneath,—everywhere
a sea of fire. We sought
a momentary shelter in the cleft of the
rocks, whilst one of our guides hastened
forward to seek a more secure asylum.
In a short time he returned and informed
us that he had discovered a spacious cavern,
which would afford us sufficient protection
from the elements. We proceeded
thither immediately, and with great difficulty
and some danger at last got into it.</p>

<p>When the storm had somewhat abated,
our guides ventured out to ascertain if it
were possible to continue our journey.
The cave in which we had taken refuge,
was so extremely dark, that, if we moved
a few paces from the entrance, we could
not see an inch before us; and we were
debating as to the propriety of leaving
it, even before the Indians came back,
when we suddenly heard a singular
groaning or growling in the farther end
of the cavern, which instantly fixed all
our attention. Wharton and myself listened
anxiously, but our inconsiderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
young friend Lincoln, together with my
huntsman, crept about on their hands
and knees, and endeavored to discover,
by groping, whence the sound proceeded.</p>

<p>They had not advanced far into the
cavern, before we heard them utter an
exclamation of surprise; and they returned
to us, each carrying in his arms,
an animal singularly marked, about the
size of a cat, seemingly of great strength
and power, and furnished with immense
fangs. The eyes were of a green color;
strong claws were upon their feet; and
a blood red tongue hung out of their
mouths. Wharton had scarcely glanced
at them, when he exclaimed in consternation,
“We have come into the den of
a ——.” He was interrupted by a fearful
cry of dismay from our guides, who
came rushing precipitately towards us,
calling out, “A tiger, a tiger!” and, at
the same time, with extraordinary rapidity,
they climbed up a cedar tree which
stood at the entrance of the cave, and
hid themselves among the branches.</p>

<p>After the first sensation of horror and
surprise, which rendered me motionless
for a moment, had subsided, I grasped
my fire-arms. Wharton had already regained
his composure and self-possession;
and he called to us to assist in
blocking up the mouth of the cave with
an immense stone which fortunately lay
near it. The sense of imminent danger
augmented our strength; for we now
distinctly heard the growl of the ferocious
animal, and we were lost beyond redemption,
if he reached the entrance before
we could get it closed. Ere this
was done we could distinctly see the
tiger bounding towards the spot, and
stooping in order to creep into his den by
the narrow opening. At this fearful moment,
our exertions were successful, and
the great stone kept the wild beast at
bay.</p>

<p>There was a small open space, however,
left between the top of the entrance
and the stone, through which we could
see the head of the animal, illuminated
by his glowing eyes, which he rolled
glaring with fury upon us. His frightful
roaring, too, penetrated to the depths
of the cavern, and was answered by the
hoarse growling of the cubs. Our ferocious
enemy attempted first to remove
the stone with his powerful claws, and
then to push it with his head from its
place; and these efforts proving abortive,
served only to increase his wrath.
He uttered a tremendous heart-piercing
growl, and his flaming eyes darted light
into the darkness of our retreat.</p>

<p>“Now is the time to fire at him,” said
Wharton, with his usual calmness; “aim
at his eyes; the ball will go through his
brain, and we shall then have a chance
to get rid of him.”</p>

<p>Frank seized his double-barrelled gun
and Lincoln his pistols. The former
placed the muzzle within a few inches
of the tiger, and Lincoln did the same.
At Wharton’s command they both drew
their triggers at the same moment; but
no shot followed. The tiger, who seemed
aware that the flash indicated an attack
upon him, sprang growling from the entrance,
but finding himself unhurt, immediately
turned back, and stationed himself
in his former place. The powder in
both pieces was wet.</p>

<p>“All is now over,” said Wharton;
“we have only now to choose whether
we shall die of hunger, together with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
these animals who are shut up along
with us, or open the entrance to the blood
thirsty monster without, and so make a
quicker end of the matter.”</p>

<p>So saying, he placed himself close beside
the stone, which for the moment defended
us, and looked undauntedly upon
the lightning eyes of the tiger. Lincoln
raved, and Frank took a piece of strong
cord from his pocket and hastened to the
further end of the cave, I knew not with
what design. We soon, however, heard
a low, stifled groaning; the tiger, which
had heard it also became more restless
and disturbed than ever. He went backwards
and forwards, before the entrance
of the cave, in the most wild and impetuous
manner; then stood still, and stretching
out his neck towards the forest, broke
forth into a deafening howl.</p>

<p>Our two Indian guides took advantage
of this opportunity, to discharge several
arrows from the tree; but the light weapons
bounded back harmless from his
thick skin. At length, however, one of
them struck him near the eye, and the
arrow remained sticking in the wound.
He now broke anew into the wildest fury,
sprang at the tree and tore it with his
claws as if he would have dragged it to
the ground. But having at length succeeded
in getting rid of the arrow, he
became more calm, and laid himself
down, as before, in front of the cave.</p>

<p>Frank now returned from the lower
end of the den, and a glance showed us
what he had been doing. In each hand,
and dangling from the end of a string,
were the two cubs. He had strangled
them, and, before we were aware what
he intended, he threw them through the
opening to the tiger. No sooner did the
animal perceive them, than he gazed
earnestly upon them, and began to examine
them closely, turning them cautiously
from side to side. As soon as he
became aware that they were dead, he
uttered so piercing a howl of sorrow,
that we were obliged to put our hands to
our ears.</p>

<p>The thunder had now ceased, and the
storm had sunk to a gentle gale; the
songs of the birds were again heard in
the neighboring forest, and the sunbeams
sparkled in the drops that hung from the
leaves. We saw, through the aperture,
how all nature was reviving, after the
wild war of elements, which had so recently
taken place; but the contrast only
made our situation the more horrible.
The tiger had laid himself down beside
his whelps. He was a beautiful animal,
of great size and strength; and his limbs
being stretched out at their full length,
displayed his immense power of muscle.
A double row of great teeth stood far
enough apart to show his large red
tongue, from which the white foam fell
in large drops.</p>

<p>All at once, another roar was heard at
a distance, and the tiger immediately
rose and answered it with a mournful
howl. At the same instant, our Indians
uttered a shriek, which announced that
some new danger threatened us. A few
moments confirmed our worst fears; for
another tiger, not quite so large as the
former, came rapidly towards the spot
where we were.</p>

<p>The howls which the tigress gave,
when she had examined the bodies of
her cubs, surpassed everything of horrible
that we had yet heard; and the tiger
mingled his mournful cries with hers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
Suddenly her roaring was lowered to a
hoarse growling, and we saw her anxiously
stretch out her head, extend her
wide and smoking nostrils, and look as if
she were determined to discover immediately
the murderers of her young. Her
eyes quickly fell upon us, and she made
a spring forward, with the intention of
penetrating our place of refuge. Perhaps
she might have been enabled, by
her immense strength, to push away the
stone, had we not, with all our united
power, held it against her.</p>

<p>When she found that all her efforts
were fruitless, she approached the tiger,
who lay stretched out beside his cubs,
and he rose and joined in her hollow
roarings. They stood together for a few
moments, as if in consultation, and then
suddenly went off at a rapid pace, and
disappeared from our sight. Their howlings
died away in the distance, and then
entirely ceased.</p>

<p>Our Indians descended from their tree,
and called upon us to seize the only possibility
of yet saving ourselves, by instant
flight, for that the tigers had only
gone round the height to seek another
inlet into the cave, with which they were
no doubt acquainted. In the greatest
haste the stone was pushed aside, and
we stepped forth from what we had considered
a living grave. We now heard
once more the roaring of the tigers,
though at a distance, and, following the
example of our guides, we precipitately
struck into a side path. From the number
of roots and branches of trees, with
which the storm had strewed our way,
and the slipperiness of the road, our
flight was slow and difficult.</p>

<p>We had proceeded thus for about a
quarter of an hour, when we found that
our way led along a rocky cliff, with innumerable
fissures. We had just entered
upon it, when suddenly the Indians,
who were before us, uttered one of their
piercing shrieks, and we immediately became
aware that the tigers were in pursuit
of us. Urged by despair, we rushed
towards one of the breaks, or gulfs in our
way, over which was thrown a bridge
of reeds, that sprang up and down at
every step, and could be trod with safety
by the light foot of the Indians alone.
Deep in the hollow below rushed an impetuous
stream, and a thousand pointed
and jagged rocks threatened destruction
on every side.</p>

<p>Lincoln, my huntsman, and myself
passed over the chasm in safety, but
Wharton was still in the middle of the
waving bridge, and endeavoring to steady
himself, when both the tigers were seen
to issue from the adjoining forest; and
the moment they descried us, they bounded
towards us with dreadful roarings.
Meanwhile, Wharton had nearly gained
the safe side of the gulf, and we were
all clambering up the rocky cliff, except
Lincoln, who remained at the reedy
bridge, to assist his friend to step upon
firm ground. Wharton, though the ferocious
animals were close upon him,
never lost his courage or presence of
mind. As soon as he had gained the
edge of the cliff, he knelt down, and with
his sword divided the fastenings by
which the bridge was attached to the rock.</p>

<p>He expected that an effectual barrier
would thus be put to the further progress
of our pursuers; but he was mistaken;
for he had scarcely accomplished his task,
when the tigress, without a moment’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
pause, rushed towards the chasm, and
attempted to bound over it. It was a
fearful sight to see the mighty animal
suspended for a moment in the air, above
the abyss; but the scene passed like a
flash of lightning. Her strength was
not equal to the distance; she fell into
the gulf, and, before she reached the
bottom, was torn into a thousand pieces
by the jagged points of the rocks.</p>

<p>Her fate did not in the least dismay
her companion; he followed her with
an immense spring, and reached the opposite
side, but only with his fore claws;
and thus he clung to the edge of the precipice,
endeavoring to gain a footing.
The Indians again uttered a wild shriek,
as if all hope had been lost.</p>

<p>But Wharton, who was nearest the
edge of the rock, advanced courageously
towards the tiger, and struck his sword
into the animal’s breast. Enraged beyond
all measure, the wild beast collected
all his strength, and, with a violent
effort, fixing one of his hind legs upon
the cliff, he seized Wharton by the thigh.
That heroic man still preserved his fortitude;
he grasped the trunk of a tree
with his left hand, to steady and support
himself, while with his right hand he
wrenched and violently turned the sword,
that was still in the breast of the tiger.
All this was the work of an instant.
The Indians, Frank, and myself hastened
to his assistance; but Lincoln, who was
already at his side, had seized Wharton’s
gun, which lay near upon the ground,
and struck so powerful a blow with the
<a id="chg6"></a>butt-end upon the head of the tiger, that
the animal, stunned and overpowered,
let go his hold and fell back into the
abyss.—<cite>Edinburgh Literary Journal.</cite></p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Ingenious Cricket.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> the mountains of Malacca there is a
species of cricket, which makes a loud
noise with its wings at certain seasons,
probably to attract its mate. Not
content with the simple sound which it
can produce by a natural action, it is said
to resort to an exceedingly curious acoustic
contrivance to increase it. In the
sides of a hole which it forms in the
earth, large enough to contain its body,
it hollows out seven small tunnels, which,
diverging from that common centre, and
penetrating towards the surface of the
ground, at length open above in a circle
of a palm’s breadth in diameter. These
cylindrical apertures, being made quite
smooth within, expand towards the top,
where each may be half an inch wide,
like so many minute speaking-trumpets.
The insect then taking its stand in the
central cavity which communicates with
these, and there exercising its fairy minstrelsy,
the sound passes through each
tube; and, whatever be the use of this
peculiar structure, the tiny musician
within makes hill-side and thicket ring
with the chirping din which he emits
from it.—<cite>Bennet and Tyerman.</cite></p>

him with great fierceness. The
poor horse kicked and plunged violently,

were thrown over him, and other means
were resorted to, but it was a long time

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">ccording</span> to a French novelist, November
is the gloomy month, in
which “the people of England hang
and drown themselves.” There is
something rather sober in the departure
of all those interesting charms that have
so attached us to summer and the early
autumn, yet we can hardly say that there
is anything <em>gloomy</em> about it. A pensive,
yet pleasing melancholy, is perhaps the
predominant feeling in contemplating the
changes that take place as the autumn
sullenly resigns the year to winter. We
have seen the fields stripped of their
crops, and the woods of their luxuriant
foliage; and now that the great purposes
of the season are accomplished, it is not
with repining or regret, that we see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
exhausted nature about to take a short
repose.</p>

<p>We have been delighted with the music
of the fields and groves, we have admired
the springing plants and expanding
flowers; now our enjoyments are
about to be somewhat of a different kind,
though they may still be closely connected
with the mysterious operations of slumbering
nature; we may still study her
work with scarce less interest than when
her utmost energies are put forth to the
work of spring and summer seasons.
Let the Englishman hang or drown, if
his fancy inclines that way; for myself,
there is much in the gloom of winter
which I could yet wish to enjoy for years
to come. There are the hard frosts,
which show an autumn morning with
every twig and every blade of grass,
every vegetable fibre, houses, rocks, and
fences, coated with a thick covering of
alabaster, like ice, converting shrubs and
thick-clustering weeds into most gorgeous
chandeliers; there are the winter
sunshine and storms, and the winter-evening
fireside. There is the promise
and hope of the future year; and above
all, there is the contemplation of the
power and goodness of Him who has furnished
the earth in all the beauty and
riches of the seasons, for the comfort and
happiness of his creatures.</p>

<p>The sun, who seems to have the immediate
control of these matters, has for
a few weeks been getting rapidly to the
south, and the summer and autumn follow
him. His declination, by the middle
of the month, is the same, and the
days are as short, as at the latter part of
January: but how different the two seasons.
Now, we generally have our Indian
summer, and then, perhaps, is the
coldest part of winter. When the earth
has become so thoroughly heated by the
longer days and more perpendicular sun
of summer, it requires some time, after
the sun has attained its greatest southern
declination, for it to cool again to the
lowest temperature of winter.</p>

<p>We are no great admirers of the mere
poetry and sentimentality of life, but,
seeing it is November, suppose we indulge
a little in the pensive mood. Let
us take one of those pure transparent
days which are only to be found at this
season, and go to the southern declivity
of some gentle swell where we may
have the woods in our rear. Now look
abroad to the south where the retiring
summer seems yet to linger, and the
autumn lies slumbering over the landscape.
Here is no bold and abrupt
coloring, no contrast of dark woods with
yellow fields; the different features and
tints seem blended into one grand mass,
forming an extended and unbroken
scene of quiet, calm serenity and loveliness.
Over head is that deep transparent
blue which belongs only to an
autumn sky, with here and there a straggling
white-edged cloud, which sometimes
passing before the sun, we see the
shadow as it travels over the plain,
darkening successively for a moment the
hills and fields until lost in the distance,
and giving a transient life and motion to
the sleeping scene before us. Now and
then a single bird is to be seen, who, as
if loth to leave the happy scenes of his
summer joys, still lingers behind, long
after his companions have departed for
southern climes. Occasionally we are
startled by the squirrel, who, with a cheek
load of hickory nuts, rustles the leaves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
as he scampers to his hiding place, to
finish stocking his cellars with provisions
for the winter. For half an hour, not a
breath of air is felt, or a sound heard; till
presently, the wind, scarcely heard at
first, begins to murmur among the trees
in the distance; approaching, it increases
to a mournful howl, bringing with it a
cloud of leaves, which, whirled in eddies
across the sky above us, afford us a lecture
“more eloquent than words,” on the
end there <em>must</em> be to all of the beautiful
and fascinating, to which we have set our
hearts and engaged our affections here.
Now the wind dies away again in moaning
sighs, the leaves settle away in the
distance, and presently all is again quiet,
lonely and silent.</p>

<p>At such times, we feel little inclined
to conversation; deeply absorbed in the
contemplation of the scene before us,
about us, and above us, we find occasion
for few words; conscious that each sees
and deeply feels the whole, the year
going reluctantly on to its grave, we find
all comment unnecessary, and words superfluous;
we want no communion with
anything save our own silent thoughts.</p>

<p>I know not how it is with others, but
I have sometimes felt <em>English</em> enough to
think, were it proper to choose, that when
I am called upon to leave all the beautiful
and interesting things that have so
long bound me to earth, I could choose
this season, and leave them with less regret
amid such a scene, when all around
is gone to decay, and the earth itself
seems to covet the repose of death.</p>

A thrush, not aware of the expansive properties

she was very much discomposed by the

she would not leave her nest. She soon
observed that a bell rang whenever a

the notice, the workmen retired to safe
positions. In a few days, when she
heard the bell, she quitted her exposed

close to their feet. There she would

<h3 class="h3head">Bill and the Boys.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The story of Dirk Heldriver, concluded.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">M. <span class="smcap">hielder</span> having attained the summit
of the pyramidal crag, to which
he had been invited, now looked
around for Hieldover. He saw a
fire which had guided him to the spot,
made of fagots burning upon the rocks,
and at a little distance, he discovered the
mouth of a cave. From this, Hieldover
soon issued, and presented himself before
his visiter. The strong light of the blazing
brands, reflected upon the faces and
forms of the two men, presented a striking
picture. The emaciated form, the
haggard features and the torn garments
of Hielder, were strongly contrasted with
the iron frame, the stern, flinty countenance,
and homely sailor’s dress of Hieldover.</p>

<p>The two men met, but no kindly greeting
passed between them. They gazed
at each other for a moment, and Hieldover
then broke the silence. “You have
come,” said he, “at my bidding, and I
will fulfil my promise. You shall see
your daughter—but you must first listen
to my story.” Saying this, he pointed to
a seat on the rock, and M. Hielder sat
down. Hieldover did the same, and then
he spoke as follows.</p>

<p>“It is now twelve years since we
parted at Amsterdam. I need not go
over the story of my father’s death—of
his intrusting my fortune and education
to your care. I need not say how you
discharged your trust, by bringing me
up in every species of folly and dissipation;
of your embezzlement of my property,
and final retreat from the country
to parts unknown. The latter event, as
you well know, occurred in my absence
from Amsterdam. When I returned to
the city I found myself a beggar, and what
was worse, my character was ruined.
You had enjoyed a high reputation for
integrity, and had taken advantage of
this to denounce me as a graceless wretch,
unworthy of protection or sympathy.
You had also circulated the story that
the vast estate bequeathed by my father
had been squandered by my profligacy.</p>

<p>“I was just twenty-one when I returned
to Amsterdam, intending to take
possession of my estate, but instead of
this, I found myself at once ruined in
fortune and fame. It is impossible for
me to describe the miseries that one
after another overwhelmed me. I applied
to friends; but they received me with
coldness or aversion. I resorted to my
companions, upon whom I had lavished
favors; but they smiled and put their
fingers sneeringly to the side of the nose.
I applied to a lawyer; but he would not
undertake my cause without a fee, and
this I could not give. At length, I bent
all the energies of my soul to one single
purpose, and that was to pursue you, to
traverse the four quarters of the globe,
if necessary, to find you, and at last to
inflict upon you some punishment adequate
to your ingratitude and your
crimes.</p>

<p>“Entering upon this design with a
fierce and feverish desire, I shipped on
board a vessel as a common sailor. I had
reason to suppose that you had gone to
Surinam, and the vessel I entered was
bound to that port. I performed the duties
of a sailor with alacrity. In the long
and tedious calm, or the raging of the
tempest, whether upon the quiet deck or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
aloft amid the shivering spars, I never
for one moment forgot my purpose. I
arrived at the destined port, and made
inquiries for you, but without success.
I engaged in the revels of my companions;
but in my maddest moments I
thought of you. I shipped for Java, for
I had been led to conjecture that you
might be there. We performed our long
voyage of alternate tempest and tranquillity.
To all around me I seemed the
most thoughtless of the unthinking men
with whom I was associated; yet it was
the burning hope of revenge that sustained
me.</p>

<p>“You were not at Java. I set out for
the Japan Isles, and reached the rock of
Nangasaki, to which the Dutch traders
are confined. You had been here, but
had departed, leaving no clew by which
you could be traced. In a daring and
reckless mood, I ventured with one of
my companions to enter into one of the
Japanese towns. We had dressed ourselves
like the natives, and for a time
were unsuspected. But at last we were
seized, severely beaten, put into an open
boat and driven out to sea. We were
forced along the coast by winds and currents,
and at last, were wrecked upon a
rocky shore. In a starving condition
we clambered up the cliffs, and made our
way to a small village. Here we were
seized and conducted from post to post,
till we reached Meaco, the residence of
the <span class="dfn">dairi</span> or king. Having been examined,
we were sentenced to perpetual
slavery in the diamond mines. These
belonged to the king, and were situated
in the mountains. For three years I
wrought in gloomy caverns, without once
seeing the light of day. Even here I did
not forget my revenge, and had still in
my bosom a conviction that I should
break the chains with which my body
was bound, escape from my rocky prison,
and fulfil my purpose. My companion
wasted away under his toil and confinement,
and expired before my eyes; but
my body and soul fed upon the hope
which had so long animated my bosom.</p>

<p>“I began to meditate an escape. I laid
my plans with deliberation, and at the
end of eleven months, they were completed.
I effected my deliverance, and
lived for two years with the wild goats
amid the recesses of the mountains. I
had learned the language and manners
of the country, and leaving my retreat,
made my way without difficulty; all suspicion
having been lulled by the time
which had elapsed since my escape. I
had concealed a number of diamonds and
other gems of great value, and carried
them with me. I was now rich, but I
regarded my wealth only as the means
by which I might traverse the world in
pursuit of you.</p>

<p>“I reached Nangasaki, and entered
a vessel bound for Amsterdam. I returned
to my native city, and for a time
engaged in the pleasures of fashionable
life. I was courted and flattered on
every side; but I became weary of blandishments,
and the thirst of revenge,
which had been forgotten, again revived
in my bosom. I came to New York, and
spent a year in search of you. At last,
I discovered your place of residence, and
learned that you had exchanged the
name of Brocken for Hielder. I learned
that you were married—that you lived
aloof from mankind, and that you were
regarded as a strange and mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
being. I visited your abode by night—I
hung around your path—I frequently
saw you, and was more than once on
the point of thrusting my poniard into
your bosom.</p>

<p>“It is strange, that, when you were
in my power, my hand seemed withheld
from striking the blow I had so long
meditated. I hesitated—I wavered. At
last my desire of revenge returned in its
full vigor—I went, determined to fulfil
my long meditated design. Concealed
in the shrubbery, I saw you approach.
I drew my dirk, and stood ready. You
came near, but your lovely child was by
your side. You paused—you sat down—you
embraced that flaxen-haired girl,
and gazed in her sunny face with the
fond affection of a parent. I had only
thought of you before as a demon; but
I now saw that you were a father, and
possessed a father’s feeling. It was a
strange revelation, and it opened a new
view to my mind. I cast my poniard
away with loathing, and another train of
thoughts took possession of my soul.</p>

<p>“I lay in wait, and seizing a favorable
opportunity, I carried your daughter
away. She is here, and she is well. I
have brought you hither; I have told
you my story—I have fulfilled my purpose.
I have no other revenge to bestow.
Keep your ill-gotten wealth—for I know
it cannot bless you. I only hope that
your innocent child may not share in
the misery which your crimes have inflicted
upon me, and must continue to
inflict upon yourself. I see a fate worse
than that of Cain, written on your brow.
There is a fire within your breast that
consumes you. One solace only is afforded
you—your daughter; and even
that is mingled with a fear that is of
itself torture. How mysterious are the
ways of Providence! When there is no
other tribunal to inflict punishment, the
soul turns upon itself, and becomes an
executioner. Dark and desolate as is
my lot, I envy not yours.”</p>

<p>Hieldover waited for no reply, but
immediately brought out Katrina and
placed her in her father’s arms. After a
short space, he led them down the cliff,
and conducted them to one of the avenues
of the mountain. He then spoke
to Hielder as follows:</p>

<p>“Farewell—we part forever. You
need not fear me—nay, forget me if you
can. I forgive the injuries you have
done me—the wreck of my existence
which you have caused. I am unfit for
the world, and I shall continue to occupy
this abode. I have lived a life of evil
thoughts and wicked passions. I will
expiate my crimes by a life of penance
in yonder cave. Beware of seeking me—of
naming me to others. I seek only
oblivion and repose. Adieu.”</p>

<p>The strange man departed, and Hielder
saw him no more. Years passed
away, and a light was often seen on the
mountains. Rumors were afloat that the
giant form of a man was sometimes seen
upon the cliffs, or gliding through the
valley beneath. The light was at last
extinguished, and the legend became current
that the bones of a man were many
years after found in the cave, and by
their side a small sack of precious gems.
The glen had long the reputation of
being haunted, and was anciently known
by the name of Heldriver’s castle.</p>

 <p class="caption"><i>Head of a New Zealander.</i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<h3 class="h3head">New Zealand.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">N<span class="smcap">ew Zealand</span> consists of two islands,
but separated only by a strait, and
composing properly only one country,
lying between 34° and 48°S
lat.; being thus about 1000 miles in
length; but the average breadth does not
exceed 100 miles. The surface is estimated
at 62,160 English square miles.
The northern island is known by the
name, not very well fitted for English
organs, of Eaheinomauwe; the southern
by that of T’avai Poenammoo. The first
is the smallest, but is distinguished by
the finest soil, and by natural features of
the boldest and grandest description.
Chains of high mountains run through
both islands, which, in the former, rise
to the height of 12,000 or 14,000 feet,
and are buried for two thirds of their
height in perpetual snow; presenting on
the greatest scale all the Alpine phenomena.
From these heights numerous
streams flow down, watering in their
course the most fertile and enchanting
valleys. The huge glaciers and plains
of snow which cover their higher regions;
the mighty torrents which pour
down from them, forming stupendous
cataracts; the lofty woods which crown
their middle regions; the hills which
wind along their feet, decked with the
brightest vegetation; the bold cliffs and
promontories which breast the might of
the southern waves; the beautiful bays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
decked with numberless villages and
canoes—all conspire to present a scene,
which even the rude eye of the navigator
cannot behold without rapture. The
soil in the valleys, and in the tracts of
land at all level, is more fertile than in
New Holland, and, with due cultivation,
would yield grain in abundance. It produces,
even spontaneously and plentifully,
roots fitted for human food, particularly
those of a species of fern, which
covers almost the whole country.</p>

<p>The natives breed pigs, and cultivate
some maize, yams and potatoes; and
there is a species of very strong flax,
which serves not only for clothing, but
fishing-lines, and various other purposes.
The mountains are clothed with a profusion
of fir trees, of a variety of species
unknown in other countries, and rising
to a magnificent height, which the tallest
pines of Norway cannot rival.</p>

<p>The natives are of a different race from
those of New Holland, belonging to that
Malay race which predominates in the
South Sea Islands. They are tall and
well formed, with large black eyes; they
are intelligent, have made some progress
in the arts of life, and are united into a
certain form of political society. These
circumstances, however, have only tended
to develop in a still more frightful
degree those furious passions which agitate
the breast of the savage. Each little
society is actuated by the deepest enmity
against all their neighbors; their daily
and nightly thought is to surprise, to
attack, to exterminate them; and when
they have gained that guilty triumph, it
is followed by devouring their victims.</p>

<p>Yet to the members of their own tribe,
or those whom they regard as friends,
they are not only mild and courteous, but
display the fondest attachment and most
tender sensibility. Families live together
in great harmony, and are seen assembled
in pleasing and harmonious groups.
On the death of their relations, they exhibit
the most impassioned and affecting
symptoms of grief, cutting their faces
with pieces of shell or bone, till the blood
flows and mixes with their tears.</p>

<p>They have a great turn for oratory,
the chiefs making speeches of two or
three hours, accompanied with vehement
gestures, to which those of the audience
correspond. Their war-canoes are very
large, adorned with much curious and
elaborate carving. Great diligence is
also exercised, and great pain endured,
in bestowing upon their skins the ornament
of tattooing; and the visages of the
chiefs are often entirely covered over
with various regular figures. This, however,
is not effected without severe pain,
causing even attacks of fever; but to
shrink in any degree from the operation
is considered as altogether derogatory to
a manly spirit. They have also a horrid
art, by which the heads of their enemies,
being dried in an oven, and exposed to a
stream of fresh air, are maintained in
a state of perfect preservation. Their
houses are by no means spacious; that
of Korra-korra, a powerful chief, measured
only nine feet long, six feet wide,
and four feet high. They are placed in
hippahs, or fortified villages, seated on
high and steep hills, ascended by pathways,
narrow, winding, and often perpendicular,
so as to be most perilous to
an European; but the New Zealander
leaps up as if it were level ground.</p>

<p>Their original arms consisted of clubs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
of stone and whalebone, of long and
pointed spears, and of the pattoo-pattoo,
or wooden battle-axe; but since the musket
has been introduced to their knowledge,
it has absorbed all their warlike
regard; and the strength of a chief is
counted, not by his men, but by his
muskets. The report of fifty being in
the possession of Korra-korra spread the
terror of his name for 200 miles round.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">ounted</span> upon the back of a small but
vigorous Dutch pony, I made my
way upon my return much more
rapidly than I had done on foot in
proceeding into the country. At the end
of about eight days, I reached the city.
During my ride I had revolved many
schemes in my head, and I had determined,
not only to find out my uncle, but,
if possible, to vindicate his reputation.
The scale of my operations was pretty
large, considering my youth; but through
life our anticipations are very apt to be
extensive in proportion as our means are
small.</p>

<p>Immediately upon arriving at Paramaribo,
I set about my inquiries; but a
fortnight passed away, and nothing had
transpired to give me the least hope of
success. But one night, as I was walking
along the quay of the city, a person
muffled up in a cloak met me, handed
me a letter, and disappeared. I hastened
to my room, opened the paper, and read
as follows. “Your uncle is an innocent
and injured man. There are those in
this city who have participated in the
means by which his character was rendered
infamous. The chief instrument
by which the base plot was executed, is
the captain of the ship that was lost. He
now lives in a splendid villa near the
city of Caraccas, under the name of
Signor Sevil.”</p>

<p>There was neither date nor signature
to this paper, and whether to consider it
as a mere imposition, or as founded in
truth and designed to aid my researches,
I could not determine. I submitted it to
my adviser, to whom I had been commended
by Mr. Hartley, and he deemed
the communication of great importance.
It was finally determined that I should
proceed to Caraccas, in the hope of ascertaining
whether the statement in the
paper was true, and if so, how far the
fact could be made available to the clearing
up of my uncle’s character. Before
my departure, I went to see my cousin
Mirabel, and proffered my claim to relationship.
She received me kindly, and
entered with enthusiasm into my projects.
I left her, and taking passage in
a small coasting vessel, set out for Caraccas.</p>

<p>This city is situated on the northern
coast of South America, and is the capital
of the fine province of Venezuela. In
about twenty days we reached our destined
port, and I set out immediately for
the city, which lies about fifteen miles
from the sea. Our road lay over mountainous
ridges, but we were rapidly and
safely carried by mules, and reached
Caraccas in the space of a few hours.</p>

<p>I found this place to contain some fifty
thousand inhabitants, nearly all of them
Spaniards. The streets were built at
right angles, and were exceedingly narrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
The houses had a gloomy look,
there being in each but one or two windows
towards the street, but in the rear
they had large courts, where there were
often very pleasant gardens, with walks
and fountains. There were several public
squares in the town, among which the
Plaça Mayor was the principal. This
was about 320 feet square, and here was
the chief market of the city. The
churches were numerous, and the cathedral
was very splendid.</p>

<p>I gave myself little time to survey the
city, but immediately entered upon the
business that had brought me hither. I
soon found that such a person as Signor
Sevil actually lived in a handsome edifice
in the suburbs of the city. Upon further
inquiry I ascertained that he had resided
there but a few years, that he was a foreigner,
and a degree of doubt and mystery
hung over his life and character.
There were even suspicions that he had
been engaged in certain piratical expeditions;
but as all this was surmise, and
he appeared to be in the possession of
wealth, the subject was little agitated.</p>

<p>I remained for several weeks, endeavoring
to trace out the history of this
individual, and became satisfied that he
was actually the captain who had commanded
the vessel in which my uncle’s
property was lost, and through whose
villany he had been made to suffer so
severely. Yet I was unable to obtain
any specific proofs that would answer
my purpose. I revolved a great many
schemes, and finally determined to seek
an interview with the captain, tell him
my object boldly, and take my chance
for the result. If I gained no advantage,
I should at least lose nothing.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I wrote a letter to the
captain, who bore the name of Signor
Sevil, stating that a person from Paramaribo
desired to see him on important
business. This I despatched to his house,
and received for answer that he would
call upon me at the place designated, on
the morrow. At the time appointed he
came, and seemed not a little surprised
at the youthfulness of the person with
whom he was to have an interview. I
began by addressing him as Captain
Pierce, remarking that I was well acquainted
with his history and character,
and that my name was Boldhero. He
started to his feet as if he had been
stung by an adder, and then seemed
about to rush upon me. I had provided
myself with a pistol, which I drew from
my bosom, and presented to his face.
This seemed to have a cooling effect;
he immediately forced a smile, resumed
his chair, and said, “Well, well, let us
hear what you have to say.”</p>

<p>I then stated that my object was to
vindicate the reputation of my uncle, and
to recover also the large amount of
money due from the insurance company
at Surinam. I assured him that my
purpose was not to bring him to justice,
but only to obtain from him a solemn
affidavit, retracting his former perjury,
with a confession of the means by which
he had been bribed to commit so foul a
wrong.</p>

<p>When I had done, the man looked at
me with a mixture of amazement and
mirth. The audacity of my proposition
seemed at once to astonish and amuse
him. After looking me steadily in the
face for a few moments, he said, with
great civility, “I will think of this proposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and when I am prepared to
erect a gallows and twist a halter for
my own execution, I will perhaps comply
with your very reasonable request.”
Saying this, the man rose from his seat,
saluted me with great politeness, and
was about to depart.</p>

<p>Stung with disappointment and indignation,
I placed my back to the door,
determined to oppose his departure.
While I stood a moment in this position,
facing the captain, my feet seemed jerked
from under me, and I fell to the floor.
At the same instant I saw that he was
thrown forcibly in an opposite direction,
and laid prostrate. I arose, but was instantly
thrown down again. I could now
perceive that the room was rocking backward
and forward; at the same time,
my ears were filled with the most terrific
sounds I ever heard. With a powerful
effort, I arose and rushed down the stairs,
into the street.</p>

<p>The earth trembled beneath my feet,
and the buildings around seemed to be
rushing into a mass of ruins. On every
side, I could hear the crash of buildings
falling to the earth; the screams of men,
women, and children, filled with despair
or crushed beneath the falling fragments;
together with the heavy and portentous
sound, like the deep bellowing of thunder,
smothered in the bowels of the earth.
Completely bewildered, I rushed along
the street, escaping as if by miracle from
the bricks and stones and timbers that
fell around me. At length I reached the
Plaça Mayor, where I had an extended
view of the scene.</p>

<p>The whole space was nearly covered
with people; priests with their crosses;
women with their children; aged men
and women, tottering with years; the
rich and the poor, the strong and the
weak, the young and the old; some silent
and some wailing; some prostrate on the
earth; others kneeling and telling their
beads; others standing erect, and spreading
upward their beseeching hands to
Heaven. While such was the spectacle
before the eye, the ear was stunned with
strange and appalling sounds, and at the
same time, the earth trembled as if the
very stones were filled with fear at the
awful visitation.</p>

<p>Around the square, most of the buildings
were prostrate; the only edifice that
seemed to defy the shock, was the cathedral,
which occupied a portion of the
open space. The agitation of the earth
continued for a few minutes, when it
gradually subsided. The trembling at
last totally ceased, the air became still,
and a deathlike silence settled over the
ruined city. It was evident that the
earthquake had passed, and the inhabitants
by slow degrees began now to recover
from their panic.</p>

<p>The desolation that pervaded the place
was, however, terrific. Thousands of
people had been killed, and many of the
living were now houseless and homeless.
Endeavoring to shun the sights of misery
that presented themselves on every
side, I wandered about, scarcely knowing
whither I went. At last I found myself
near my lodgings. The building was
still standing, though considerably injured.
While I stood before it, surveying
its aspect, I heard a deep groan near at
hand. On going to the spot from whence
the sound issued, I found the captain
half buried beneath a mass of bricks. I
went to him, and he instantly recognized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
me. “For God’s sake give me help,”
said he, “though it is perhaps of little
consequence, for I have but a few hours
to live.”</p>

<p>Touched by the poor man’s sufferings,
I immediately fell to work to extricate
him, but found the task beyond my
strength. I ran for help, which I obtained
with some difficulty, and the sufferer was
taken up, and carried into the adjacent
building, where I had lodged. “I am
dying,” said he to me. “I beg you to
send for a priest. Be speedy, as you
would have mercy on the soul of a great
sinner.”</p>

<p>I ran to the Plaça Mayor, and speedily
brought a friar to the bedside of the dying
man. We were all required to leave the
room, and the captain proceeded to make
his confession in the ear of the priest.
The holy father told him that his crimes
were great, and he could only offer him
absolution upon condition that he would
put his declaration in writing, and in such
a form as would enable the parties he
had injured to obtain justice.</p>

<p>After a violent struggle with his pride,
the sufferer yielded, and a magistrate
was called to receive his dying affirmation.
This was executed in due form,
and in my presence. It completely exculpated
my uncle from all blame. It
declared that his ship was lost by stress
of weather, and that he, the captain, had
been bribed to give perjured evidence, in
stating that the catastrophe had been
brought about by my uncle’s orders.
Scarcely had he finished this declaration,
and sworn to it, when he was seized with
spasms, his mind wandered, and with
a struggle that shook his whole frame,
he expired.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Ten">X.</abbr></p>

<p>The object of my visit to Caraccas
having been completed in a manner
which seemed almost miraculous, I was
impatient to return to Paramaribo, and
take counsel as to what steps should be
adopted for the discovery of my uncle.
I therefore took passage in the first vessel
bound for that port; and in the space
of twenty-four days, found myself again
sailing up the Surinam.</p>

<p>We soon landed, and after despatching
a letter to Mr. Hartley, informing him of
my success, and requesting him immediately
to repair to Paramaribo, I hastened
to the house of M. Scager, my
uncle’s father-in-law; I had seen the old
gentleman before my departure for Caraccas,
but had not consulted him as
to the object of my expedition. Such,
indeed, had been the bitterness of his
feelings towards my uncle, on account
of the disgrace associated with his name,
that even an allusion to him excited his
anger.</p>

<p>I had, however, seen my black-eyed
cousin Mirabel, and imparted to her my
scheme, and the hopes I entertained of
rescuing her father’s name from reproach,
and if successful in this, my determination
to range the world until I might
discover him.</p>

<p>Young as she was, Mirabel entered
into my views with ardor, and I believe
that my own resolution was quickened
in no small degree by the feelings which
animated her own bosom, and which I saw
vividly painted upon her countenance.</p>

<p>When I reached the house, M. Scager
was absent, and my first interview was
with Mirabel. She saw me, indeed, before
I reached the door, and was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
to fly towards me; but she suddenly
stopped and gazed earnestly in my face.
Seeming to be satisfied with the tidings
it bore, she rushed forward, and I received
her in my arms.</p>

<p>It may seem that this proceeding suited
my name better than my age and
condition; but it must be considered
that Mirabel was my cousin, that I had
achieved a great service in behalf of her
father, and that the girl had very handsome
black eyes.</p>

<p>My story was soon told, and I cannot
describe the happiness that shone in
Mirabel’s face. But in a short time I
perceived that it was shaded by a look
of the deepest sorrow. I inquired the
cause, and begging me to excuse her
seeming ingratitude, she told me that her
anxiety to know her father’s fate, and to
see him if living, was now so great as
even to drown the enjoyment derived
from knowing that his name would now
be rescued from the shame which had
long attended it. I spoke cheeringly to
her in reply, and promised again to compass
sea and land in search of him.</p>

<p>While we were thus engaged, M. Scager
returned. I hesitated as to the manner
in which I should communicate the
intelligence I had brought. Mirabel,
seeing my embarrassment, took the papers
which I had obtained from Caraccas,
and placing them in her grandfather’s
hands, begged him to read them at his
leisure. The old man sat down, and
while he was taking out his spectacles,
Mirabel slipped out of the room, beckoning
me with a fairy sweep of her finger
to follow her.</p>

<p>We had not long been absent, when
we were recalled, and M. Scager inquired
how these papers came into Mirabel’s
hands. She briefly told him how I had
obtained them. The old man looked at
me steadfastly and doubtingly for a moment,
and then, seeming to assent to the
truth of the documents he had been perusing,
he exclaimed, “After all, Mirabel,
your father was what he seemed, a noble
and an honest man, and I have done him
grievous wrong. Come here, my child.”
As he said this, he held out his hand,
and Mirabel approaching him, was taken
in his arms, and the old man’s tears fell
thick and fast upon her face. I felt the
scene to be almost more than I could
bear, and hastily left the room.</p>

<p>I need not detail the events which
immediately followed. It will be sufficient
to say that in the course of a few
days Mr. Hartley arrived, and upon consulting
a lawyer, it was thought that the
papers I had procured would be not only
sufficient to establish my uncle’s innocence,
but to enable him, if living, to
recover from the insurance company an
immense sum of money, not only for the
loss of his cargo, but for interest, and the
conspiracy which had been entered into
with the captain of the wrecked vessel.
If he were dead, these sums, it was
thought, could be recovered by his heirs.</p>

<p>It now became a matter of extreme
interest to trace my uncle’s career from
the time he escaped from the prison and
left Paramaribo. M. Scager had received
several letters from him, but these did
not clearly indicate the place of his
abode. After consulting these letters,
and putting together all the information
that could be obtained, it was determined,
that I should proceed with all possible
despatch, to Valparaiso, at which place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
it appeared tolerably certain he had been
established in business about ten years
before. Being supplied with letters of
introduction and plenty of money, I took
my departure; not, however, without
an affectionate farewell from my gentle
cousin.</p>

<p>My plan was to proceed to Buenos
Ayres in a vessel, and cross the continent
in a westerly direction, to Chili, of
which Valparaiso is the chief commercial
port. I accordingly entered on board a
brig bound for Buenos Ayres. We were
soon upon the ocean, and I had now leisure
to reflect upon the circumstances
which had recently transpired, and the
prospects that lay before me.</p>

<p>Although I was still a youth, I had
already accomplished something, and was
now engaged in an enterprise seldom
committed to the charge of one so young
as myself. I was surprised to observe
the change which had taken place in my
feelings and character in the space of a
few months. When I first arrived at
Paramaribo, I was but a boy. I had now
the settled thoughts, plans and purposes
of a man. I was bound to a distant
country, and dangers and trials lay before
me; but these did not in the slightest degree
shake my resolution. Though I was
calm, I had still the ardent hope and sanguine
expectation which belong to youth.</p>

<p>Although I knew the extreme uncertainty
of my being able to find my uncle,
yet I had still a sort of faith that I should
at last succeed in this. “What happiness,”
thought I, “would flow from such
an event!” I often indulged my imagination
in picturing his return—in fancying
the meeting between him and his daughter.
I thought also of the benefits that
might ultimately flow to my mother and
sister; and I had likewise some dreams
of a vague but agreeable nature which
had relation to Mirabel and myself.</p>

<p>Our vessel stole on before a gentle
wind, but though I was entirely at leisure,
my mind was never more busy; my faculties
seemed roused in every respect,
and although my thoughts dwelt so much
upon the particular purpose of my present
expedition, I still noticed with lively
interest every object of curiosity that
came in my way. I was greatly struck
with the splendor of the starry firmament
amid these tropical regions. As
we proceeded farther and farther south,
groups of stars, which I had never seen
before, and which are not visible in the
northern hemisphere, came to view.
Many of these were exceedingly brilliant,
and at night, in the absence of the
moon, seemed to fill the whole atmosphere
with a mild lustre.</p>

<p>Nor were the objects connected with
the sea hardly less interesting. Flocks
of flying fishes, pursued by dolphins in
the water, occasionally burst from the
briny element, and shot like arrows for
a considerable distance through the air.
Huge sharks accompanied our vessel, day
after day, and a large species of seal
which has often been taken for the mermaid,
would occasionally lift its head
above the wave, and having surveyed us
for a moment, would sink back into the
water. The albatross, the largest of seafowl,
occasionally swept by us, and myriads
of wild ducks, seeming like skeins
of thread bending and winding against
the verge of the distant horizon, skimmed
the surface of the waters, along the
shores of the continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
In about forty days from the time of
our departure, we entered the mouth of
the mighty river La Plata. Such was
its width, that it seemed like the sea; but
we gradually approached the shore, and
on the southern bank of the river, 150
miles from its mouth, we now saw the
city of Buenos Ayres. Anchoring at the
distance of seven or eight miles from the
town, on account of the shallow water,
the captain and myself entered a boat
and were rowed to the city.</p>

<p>My stay in this place was short, and
I had not an opportunity to examine it
with care. It stretches along a high
bank for about two miles, and contains
about 60,000 inhabitants. These are
chiefly of Spanish descent. There are a
few negroes, some of whom are slaves.
By far the larger portion of the lower
class are Indians, who perform the common
labor, and discharge the menial
offices of society. They speak the Spanish
language, and have forgotten alike
their original habits and their native
tongue.</p>

<p>On inquiry, I found that the distance
from Buenos Ayres to Valparaiso was
about a thousand miles. The road led
across the vast plains called the <span class="dfn">Pampas</span>,
and also over the lofty mountainous chain
called the Andes. It was rough and ill
wrought, and was therefore seldom travelled
with carriages. I learned, also,
that it was beset with thieves and robbers.</p>

<p>In four days after my arrival, my
preparations were complete, and I departed.
I was mounted on a strong
horse, which had been caught upon the
plains and trained to the saddle. I was
attended by a stout Indian, also well
mounted, as a guide. We were each
armed with a brace of pistols and a dirk.
Thus equipped, we set forward.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the city we entered
upon a broken country, which was for
the most part entirely in a state of nature.
Here and there, was a villa surrounded
by a plantation, but with these exceptions,
everything had a wild aspect. It
was now May—a period at which, in the
land of my nativity, the trees and plants
are springing into life. But here, it was
autumn, and the sere and yellow leaf
was visible over the landscape. Still,
many of the shrubs and grasses maintained
their verdure, and put forth their
blossoms. The aspect of nature, however,
was strange. The trees were of
kinds I had never seen before, and the
birds were all different from those with
which I had been familiar.</p>

<p>In the course of two days, we were
upon the pampas. These resembled the
prairies of the west, but they are on a
far grander scale. They stretch out to
an amazing distance—their whole extent
being nearly ten times as great as that
of New England. The surface is slightly
undulating, and generally covered with
grass. A few groups of stunted palm
trees are visible, and pools of salt water
are occasionally met with.</p>

<p>Along the road we found huts, about
twenty miles apart, designed for the
accommodation of travellers. We sometimes
met persons on horseback, and saw
numerous herds of wild cattle and troops
of horses grazing upon the plains. We
had several opportunities of witnessing
the skill of the hunters in taking these
animals with the lasso. This is a long
rope with a noose at the end. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
hunter, who is mounted, carries this in a
coil upon his arm; when he approaches
his prey, he whirls it in the air, and at
last throws it with such skill and precision
that the noose falls over the animal’s
neck.</p>

<p>We one day saw a hunter noose a
wild bull at a short distance from us.
When the lasso was thrown, the animal
was at full speed, and the hunter in chase,
at the distance of about twenty feet.
The noose was immediately drawn tight
around the neck of the flying beast.
Wild with fright and pain, the creature
rushed forward, bellowing with all his
lungs. The huntsman held on to the
rope; the horse, seeming to understand
the game, kept in a position to strain it
to the utmost, and at the same time to
embarrass the progress of the maddened
fugitive. At this the creature approached
the road, his mouth foaming, his tongue,
swollen and black, hanging from his
mouth, and his eyeballs seeming ready
to gush from their sockets. Attempting
to leap across a chasm, he faltered, and
fell with a heavy groan into the middle
of the path. The hunter sprung from
his horse, and plunged a knife deep into
his neck. The bull struggled, rose to his
feet and plunged furiously forward. But
he soon staggered, and reeling round and
round, fell dead to the earth.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">The Bear and Panther.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was on as beautiful an autumnal day
as ever ushered in the Indian summer,
that I made an excursion after game
among a group of mountains, or rather
on a link in the great chain of the Alleghany
range, which runs in a northeastern
direction in that part of Pennsylvania
which bounds the New York line.</p>

<p>I had kept the summit of the mountains
for several miles, without success, for a
breeze had arisen shortly after sunrise
which rattled through the trees, and made
it unfavorable for hunting on dry ground;
and indeed the only wild animal I saw
was a bear, that was feeding on another
ridge across a deep valley, and entirely
out of reach of my rifle shot. I therefore
descended the mountain in an oblique
direction, towards the salt springs, which
I soon reached, and after finding others
had preceded me here, I left the spot for
another mountain on which I intended
to pass the remainder of the day, gradually
working my way home. This mountain
was covered with chestnut trees, and
here it was that I caught a glimpse of
the bear from the other ridge, and found
he had disappeared but a short time previous
to my arrival on this mountain.
I followed his track for three miles, for
chestnuts lay in abundance on the ground,
and bears, like hogs, root up the leaves
in search of food beneath, and it no doubt
had lingered about here eating its meal
until my near approach gave warning of
its danger. This I could discover, as the
leaves having been wet by the melted
frost on the top, a path could be traced
where the bear in running had turned
the dried part of the leaves uppermost.
I quickened my pace along the mountain
side and around the turn of the mountain,
with the hopes of surprising the
bear, and after a rapid chase for the distance
above mentioned, all proved fruitless,
and I relinquished further pursuit.
Warm with this exercise, and somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
fatigued, I descended the mountain side,
and took my seat beside a stream of water
which gently washed the base of the
mountain, and emptied itself into the
head of the waters of the Susquehannah.</p>

<p>I had remained, sitting on a fallen tree
whose branches extended considerably
into the water, for perhaps an hour and
a half, when of a sudden I heard a rustling
among the leaves on the mountain
immediately above my head, which at
first was so distant that I thought it
merely an eddy in the wind, whirling the
leaves from the ground; but it increased
as rapidly, and approached so near the
spot where I sat, that instinctively I seized
my rifle, ready in a moment to meet any
emergency which might offer.</p>

<p>That part of the mountain where I was
seated, was covered with laurel and other
bushes, and owing to the density of this
shrubbery, I could not discover an object
more than ten yards from me; this, as
will afterwards appear, afforded me protection;
at any rate it conduced to my
success. The noise among the leaves
now became tremendous, and the object
approached so near, that I distinctly heard
an unnatural, grunting noise, as if from
some animal in great distress. At length,
a sudden plunge into the water, not more
than twenty yards from me, uncovered
to my view a full-grown black bear, intent
upon nothing but its endeavors to
press through the water and reach the
opposite shore. The water on an average
was not more than two feet deep,
which was not sufficient for the animal
to swim, and too deep to run through;
consequently the eagerness with which
the bear pressed through the water, created
such a splashing noise as fairly
echoed through the hills. Without
scarcely a thought, I brought my rifle to
my shoulder with the intention of shooting,
but before I could sight it correctly,
the bear rushed behind a rock which
shielded it from my view; this gave me
a momentary season for reflection, and
although I could have killed the bear so
soon as it had passed the rock, I determined
to await the result of such extraordinary
conduct in this animal; for I was
wonder-struck at actions which were not
only strange but even ludicrous,—there
not appearing then any cause for them.
The mystery, however, was soon unravelled.</p>

<p>The stream of water was not more
than ten rods in width, and before the
bear was two thirds across it, I heard
another rustling, on the mountain side,
among the leaves, as if by jumps, and a
second plunge into the water convinced
me that the bear had good cause for its
precipitation; for here, pressing hard at
its heels, was a formidable antagonist in
an enormous panther, which pursued the
bear with such determined inveteracy,
and appalling growls, as made me shudder
as with a chill.</p>

<p>The panther plunged into the water
not more than eighteen or twenty yards
from me, and had it been but one third
of that distance, I feel convinced I should
have been unheeded by this animal, so
intent was it on the destruction of the
bear. It must indeed be an extraordinary
case which will make a panther plunge
into water, as it is a great characteristic
of the feline species always to avoid
water, unless driven to it, either by necessity
or desperation; but here nature
was set aside, and some powerful motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
predominated in the passions of this animal,
which put all laws of instinct at
defiance, and unlike the clumsy bustling
of the bear through the water, the panther
went with bounds of ten feet at a
time, and ere the former reached the
opposite shore, the latter was midway of
the stream. This was a moment of thrilling
interest, and that feeling so common
to the human breast, when the strong is
combating with the weak, now took possession
of mine, and espousing the cause
of the weaker party, abstractedly from
every consideration which was in the
wrong, I could not help wishing safety
to the bear, and death to the panther.
Under the impulse of these feelings,
I once more brought my rifle to my
shoulder, with the intention of shooting
the panther through the heart, but in
spite of myself I shrunk from the effort.
Perhaps it was well I reserved my fire,
for had I only wounded the animal, I
might have been a victim to its ferocity.</p>

<p>So soon as the bear found there was
no possibility of escape from an issue
with so dreadful an enemy, on reaching
the opposite bank of the stream,
it shook the water from its hair like a
dog, and ran about fifteen feet on the
bank, and lay directly on its back in a
defensive posture; this it had scarcely
done when the panther reached the water’s
edge, and then, with a yell of vengeance,
it made one bound, and sprang,
with outstretched claws and spitting like
a cat, immediately on the bear, which
lay in terror on the ground, ready to
receive its antagonist; but the contest
was soon at an end. Not more easily
does the eagle rend in sunder its terror-stricken
prey, than did the enraged panther
tear in scattered fragments the helpless
bear; it appeared but the work of a
moment, and that moment was one of
unrelenting vengeance; for no sooner did
the panther alight on its victim, than
with the most ferocious yells, it planted
its hinder claws deep in the entrails of
the bear, and by a few rips, tore its antagonist
in pieces. Although the bear
was full grown, it must have been young
and in want of energy, for it was so
overcome with dread as not to be able to
make the least resistance.</p>

<p>Satisfied with glutting its vengeance,
the panther turned from the bear and
came directly to the water’s edge to
drink, and allay the parching thirst created
by so great excitement, after which
it looked down and then up the stream,
as though it sought a place to cross, that
it might avoid the water; and then, as
if satisfied with revenge, and enjoying
its victory, stood twisting and curling its
tail, like a cat, and then commenced licking
itself dry.</p>

<p>The animal was now within thirty-five
yards of me, and seeing no prospect of
its recrossing the stream, I took rest for
my rifle on a projecting limb of the tree
on which I still sat, and fired directly at
the panther’s heart. The moment I discharged
my rifle the monster made a
spring about six feet perpendicular, with
a tremendous growl, which reverberated
among the rocks, and fell in the same
spot whence it sprang, with its legs extended,
and lay in this situation, half
crouched, rocking from side to side, as if
in the dizziness of approaching death. I
saw plainly that my fire was fatal, but I
had too much experience to approach this
enemy, until I could no longer discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
signs of life. I therefore reloaded my
rifle, and with a second shot I pierced
immediately behind the ear. Its head
then dropped between its paws, and all
was quiet.</p>

<p>On examining the panther, no marks
of violence appeared, except where my
rifle balls had passed completely through,
within a foot of each other; but on turning
the animal on its back, I discovered
it to be a female, and a mother, and by
the enlargement of her teats, had evidently
been suckling her young. From
this circumstance, I supposed the bear
had made inroads on her lair, and probably
had destroyed her kittens. I was
the more convinced of this from the fact
that I never knew from my own experience,
nor could I learn from the oldest
hunters of my acquaintance, an instance
wherein a bear and a panther engaged
in combat;—and again, no circumstance
but the above would be sufficient to awaken
that vindictive perseverance in the
passions of a panther, which would lead
to the annihilation of so formidable an
animal as a bear.—<cite>Cabinet of Natural
History, and American Field Sports.</cite></p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Cotton Plant.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> plant grows spontaneously in the
hot or tropical portions of the globe.
It derives its name from the Arabian
word <span class="dfn">Kotôn</span>; and is one of the four
great materials designed by Providence
for human clothing—flax, wool and silk
being the other three. It is remarkable
that neither of these useful articles was
the natural product of Europe. All were
indigenous to Asia. Cotton and flax
were also natives of Africa and America.</p>

<p>Cotton, which is the most important
of these articles, was the last to be generally
diffused. Silk, wool and linen
were in use three or four thousand years
ago, but cotton was introduced at a later
date, and up to the time of our Saviour,
was almost unknown as a material for
clothing, except in India. Even in the
middle ages, we hear no mention of
cotton garments in Europe. The Chinese,
who have taken the lead in so many arts,
did not adopt cotton for use till the eleventh
century, though, for four hundred
years previous, they had cultivated it as
an ornamental shrub in their gardens.
Even at the present day, China imports
the wool of this plant for manufacture.</p>

<p>Cotton was grown, to a small extent,
in the United States, nearly two hundred
years ago; but it was not extensively
introduced till many years after. In
1786, Mr. Madison, writing to a friend,
says, “there is no reason to doubt that
the United States will one day become a
great cotton producing country.”</p>

<p>In 1792, the whole crop of the country
was only 138,328 lbs.; 1795, it was
6,276,300 lbs.; and in 1842, it was
783,221,800 lbs.!!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>About two thirds of this immense
quantity goes to Europe, chiefly to England,
and some to France. Nearly one
third is used in the manufactures of the
United States. At Lowell, in Massachusetts,
the several establishments make
about 75 millions of yards of cotton cloth
every year; and use almost 23 millions
of pounds of cotton wool, annually.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Election of President.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hat</span> an agitation seems to shake
this whole country from Maine to
Louisiana! By day we hear the
shout of mighty gatherings of the
people, and by night, torch-light processions
are seen throwing their lights and
shadows along the streets. Hickory poles
lift their tall tops to the skies on every
hand, and flags and streamers are waving
in every breeze, and on every side.
The names of Polk and Dallas are seen
dancing amid the stars and stripes, in one
direction, and those of Clay and Frelinghuysen,
in another. Even many of the
boys and girls have hoisted their flags
and play whig and democrat, like their
fathers! Perhaps both child and parent,
in many cases, know just about as much
of what this all means—the one as the
other.</p>

<p>It would be a long story to tell all
about the election of President; but we
must at least say a few words about it.
Every four years the people of this
country choose a man to rule over this
great nation of twenty millions of people.
The way the election or choice is made
is this: the people of each of the twenty-six
states, choose certain persons, called
Electors, and these meet together, and
cast their votes for President. The person
who has the highest number of votes
is chosen, and he removes to the city of
Washington, where he lives in a fine
edifice, called the White House. He
holds his office for four years, and then
another election of President takes place,
as above described.</p>

<p>The two leading candidates for President,
at this time, are Henry Clay of
Kentucky, and James K. Polk of Tennessee.</p>

<span class="smcap">Benjamin Constandt.</span>—This celebrated
French orator had a cat which was so
great a pet that she attended him in the
morning before he got up, followed him
into his study after breakfast, and played
and reposed where she liked. One day,
when Constandt was expected to make an
important speech in the chamber of deputies,
his friends, finding that he was absent
after his time from the arena, came to
seek him at his house, and going into
his study, found him quietly reading some
book that had evidently nothing to do
with the matter in hand; and when they
told him that everybody was waiting for
him, “What can I do?” said he; “look
there; my cat is sleeping in the sun on
the papers I have prepared for my speech,
and till she wakes, how can I take her
off them?”</p>

board on the corner of the street, prohibiting
public begging. He marched
straight to the parsonage, and asked to
see the minister; after a little hesitation
the girl admitted him to the study. Pat
immediately slipped up alongside the
minister, and whispered into his ear,
“Your reverence will please give me
something in private, and bad luck catch
me if I mention it.” Pat’s plan answered
the purpose; the minister was amused
at the poor starving fellow before him,
and Pat retired from the audience, asking
down blessings on the “minister, his
wife and childer—good luck to the whole
of them!”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Dr. Watts.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> are few persons, whose names
are recorded in history, to whom
mankind are more indebted than
Isaac Watts, the author of the Hymns
for Infant Minds, and of the version of
the Psalms in common use for sacred
music. How many thousands of children
have had their minds touched with religious
emotions, by reading his juvenile
rhymes! how many millions of grown up
persons have had their piety elevated, by
the influence of his sacred songs!</p>

<p>This great and good man was born at
Southampton, England, July 17, 1674.
He displayed good talents at an early
age, and wrote pleasing verses in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
childhood. He was educated at London,
and became in due time a Dissenting
minister. Though his health was always
feeble, he discharged his pastoral duties
with zeal and fidelity, and found time to
write many good books. Those we have
already mentioned are the most celebrated,
because they have proved to be the
most extensively useful.</p>

<p>Dr. Watts’ life affords abundant proof,
that a man even of frail constitution, and
possessing by no means wonderful genius,
may yet do incalculable good to mankind,
provided he has a heart warmed
with piety toward God, and kind, tender
emotions toward his fellow men. How
different is such a life, from that of the
conqueror, or miser, or lover of pleasure;
and how different must be the estimate
which the All Wise makes of it, from
what he does of the man who lives only
for himself—whoever he may be!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3 class="h3head">Texas.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap">s</span> the whigs and democrats are talking
a great deal about Texas, some of
our young readers are desirous of
knowing something about it. We
therefore propose to give a brief account
of it.</p>

<p>This country lies on the Gulf of Mexico,
and is bounded on the north and east
by the United States, on the south by
the Gulf of Mexico, and on the west by
Mexico. The people of the republic
claim the country to the Rio del Norte
on the west. If we take this boundary,
its whole extent is about 300,000 square
miles, and is eight times as large as New
England. It contains nearly 250,000,000
of acres.</p>

<p>The western regions are mountainous,
and are said to abound in mineral wealth.
The remaining portions of the territory
are diversified with hill and dale, though
the general aspect has a level character.
The rivers are numerous, and the water
pure.</p>

<p>Texas presents a variety of soil. This
is divided into three kinds, <span class="dfn">river bottoms</span>,
<span class="dfn">bottom prairies</span>, and <span class="dfn">high prairies</span>.
These are all rich, deep, and productive.
The climate of Texas is very fine for a
hot country. The low grounds are unwholesome,
but the higher portions are
otherwise. Snow is seldom known in
the southern districts, and the winter
seems like our spring.</p>

<p>The productions are numerous. All
kinds of grain and garden vegetables
thrive here. Besides these, sweet potatoes,
sugar cane, tobacco, coffee, indigo,
vanilla, cotton, silk, hemp, flax, honey,
wax, cochineal, are easily produced. The
soil and climate are particularly favorable
to cotton. Of this and many other products,
two crops may be obtained in a
year.</p>

<p>Among the animals, wild horses, buffalo,
deer, and a great variety of smaller
game are abundant. Gold and silver
abound in the mountains, and coal, iron
ore, and salt are found in other parts of
the country.</p>

<p>Texas formerly belonged to Mexico,
but a good many people from the United
States having settled there, they began
to talk, about ten years ago, of making
themselves independent. A convention
assembled in March, 1835, and made a
declaration to that effect. On the 21st<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
of the following April, a great battle took
place, at San Jacinto, in which the Mexican
General Santa Anna was defeated
and taken prisoner. From this time,
the country has remained free from invasion,
but Mexico still claims it as a
province and threatens to reduce it again
to subjection.</p>

<p>The number of inhabitants in all Texas
is probably not equal to that of Boston.
They are, however, increasing. The
people live for the most part in poor huts,
but some good houses are to be found.
There are a few churches and some
schools. But although the climate is
fine, and food is abundant, those who go
to reside there, from the settled portions
of the United States, must live without
many of the comforts which they had
formerly enjoyed. Slavery is tolerated,
and <a id="chg7"></a>many people do not wish that a new
slave region should be added to the
United States. The whigs are opposed
to its annexation; and the democrats are
in favor of it.</p>

<p>The following description of a wedding
which took place in 1842, is furnished
by a Scotch traveller, and will
show how people marry and are given
in marriage in this new country.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>“After sixteen miles’ journey down a
river by moonlight, and as many more
across the rough and sea-like bay of Galveston,
enlivened by merry jocund talk
all the way, we arrived about dawn at the
new settlement of the Rock family. It
was a large deserted barn or warehouse
near Clare Creek. The family was already
up and stirring, and engaged in
active preparation for the important ceremony;
and, to my surprise, the supply
of eatables and drinkables was both
varied and great—all, however, being
presents from the bridegroom, one Luke,
a wealthy land owner for Texas, in possession
of much cleared ground, and
many hundred head of cattle. It may
be <a id="chg8"></a>a matter of surprise that a man well to
do in the world should have chosen a
bride so every way rude and uneducated;
but in Texas women are scarce, and then
the lover might have looked far before
he could have found a more cheerful and
good natured companion, more willing to
learn, more likely to be loving, faithful,
and true, than Betsy Rock.</p>

<p>“The blushing bride received me in a
cotton gown, shoes and stockings, and
other articles of civilized clothing previously
unknown to her, and in which she
felt sufficiently awkward. But Luke
had sent them, and Betsy wished to appear
somebody on her wedding day.
About eight o’clock the visiters began to
arrive. First came a boat full of men
and women from Galveston, bringing
with them a negro fiddler, without whom
little could have been done. Then came
Dr. Worcester and his lady from St.
Leon, in a canoe; after them Col. Brown,
from Anahuac, in his <span class="dfn">dug-out</span>; and,
about nine, the bridegroom and four male
and an equal number of female companions
on horseback, the ladies riding
either before or behind the gentlemen on
pillions. Ere ten, there were thirty odd
persons assembled, when a most substantial
breakfast was sat down to, chiefly
consisting of game, though pork, beef,
coffee, and, rarer still, bread, proved that
Luke had had a hand in it.</p>

<p>“This meal being over, the boat in
which the party from Galveston had
come up, and which was an open craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
for sailing or pulling, was put in requisition
to convey the bride and bridegroom
to the nearest magistrate, there to plight
their troth. The distance to be run was
six miles with a fair wind going, but
dead against us on our return. The
party consisted of Luke, who was a
young man of powerful frame, but rather
unpleasant features; the bride and bride’s
maid, (Mary Rock officiating in this capacity,)
papa of course, myself as captain,
and eight men to pull us back. The
breeze was fresh, the craft a smart sailer,
the canvass was rap full, and all therefore
being in our favor, we reached West
Point, the residence of Mr. Parr, the
magistrate, in less than an hour.</p>

<p>“We found our Texian Solon about to
start in chase of a herd of deer, just reported
by his son as visible, and being
therefore in a hurry, the necessary formalities
were gone through, the fee paid,
and the usual document in the possession
of the husband in ten minutes. The
eye of the old squatter was moistened as
he gave his child away; some natural
tears <em>she</em> shed, but dried them soon; and
presently everybody was as merry as
ever.</p>

<p>“No sooner were the formalities concluded,
than we returned to the boat, and
to our great delight found that, close-hauled,
we could almost make the desired
spot. The wind had shifted a
point, and ere ten minutes, we were
again clean full, the tide with us, and the
boat walking the waters at a noble rate.
All looked upon this as a good omen
and were proportionably merrier. About
one o’clock Mr. and Mrs. Charles Luke
were presented by old Rock to the assembled
company at the barn; and, after an
embrace from her mother, the bride led
the way accompanied by her lord and
master, to the dinner table.</p>

<p>“The woods, prairies, and waters, as
well as the Galveston market, had all
liberally contributed their share of provender.
Wild turkeys, ducks, geese,
haunches of venison, were displayed,
beside roast beaf, pork, red-fish, Irish and
sweet potatoes, pumpkin and apple pie,
and an abundant supply of whiskey,
brandy, and Hollands, without which a
<i lang="fr">fête</i> in Texas is nothing thought of. An
hour was consumed in eating and drinking
when Sambo was summoned to
take his share in the day’s proceedings.
Tables, such as they were, were cleared
away, the floor swept, partners chosen,
and, despite the remonstrance of one
of the faculty present, Dr. Worcester,
against dancing so shortly after a heavy
meal, all present, the dissentient included,
began to foot it most nimbly.</p>

<p>“Never was there seen such dancing
since the world began, never such laughing,
such screaming, such fiddling. Every
one took off shoes and stockings. I was
compelled to do so, to save the toes of
my especial partner, and to the rapid
music of the old negro, reels and country
dances were rattled off at a most surprising
rate. All talked, and joked, and
laughed, such couples as were tired retreating
to seek refreshment; but the
dancing never ceasing, except at rare
intervals, when Sambo gave in from
sheer fatigue and thirst. Such was the
state of things until about nine o’clock,
when a sudden diminution in our number
was noticed by all present. The
bride and bridegroom were missed, as
well as the four couples who accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Luke. Rushing into the open air,
we descried the husband and wife on
their fine black horse galloping beneath
the pale moon across the prairie, escorted
by their friends. A loud shout was given
them, and those who remained, returned
to the house to renew the dancing which
was kept up until a late hour. It was
four days after my departure ere I regained
my companions at Todville.</p>

<p>“Such was the wedding of one of those
hardy pioneers of civilization, whose
descendants may yet be members of
a great and powerful nation.”</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">A Physician’s Dog.</span>—An eminent physician
of Chenango county, New York,
had a faithful dog named Bent, that always
attended him in his visits around
the neighboring villages. He could never
prevail on him to take a place in his vehicle,
but he would follow him on foot
until the doctor stopped; when, the instant
he alighted from the vehicle, Bent
would spring in and protect his property.
If any one dared to approach the horse,
the dog gave him to understand, by a
most significant growl, that he must be
careful how he trespassed on the rights
of his master. At home, when his mistress
had been washing, and left her
clothes in the yard over night to dry,
she had only to call the attention of Bent
to the circumstance, and he would keep
guard faithfully until morning.</p>

<p>The health of the doctor became seriously
impaired, and he made a voyage
to Europe with the hope of regaining it.
A few days after his departure the dog
became very uneasy, and scoured the
village in search of him. Having become
evidently satisfied that his master was
not to be found in the immediate vicinity
of his residence, he made an excursion
about the country, to the distance of fifty
or sixty miles, and stopped at every
house where his master had ever been,
apparently in the hope of finding him.
He was gone nearly three weeks, but
finally he came home, and gave up further
search in despair. Upon the return
of the doctor, the dog manifested his joy
in the most sagacious manner. He threw
his fore paws around his neck, and embraced
him very affectionately. From
that moment he was unwilling to go into
the kitchen at night, until he had satisfied
himself that the doctor had gone to rest.
He would insist on entering his bedroom,
and would raise himself upon the bed and
look in to see if he was there. At the
doctor’s death, the dog seemed to be perfectly
conscious of the loss he had sustained,
and testified his sorrow in so affecting
a manner, that it was remarked
by every person that saw him.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">Generous Revenge.</span>—A young man,
desirous of getting rid of his dog, took
it along with him to the Seine. He hired
a boat, and rowing into the middle of the
stream, threw the animal in. The poor
creature attempted to climb up the side
of the boat, but his master, whose intention
was to drown him, constantly pushed
him back with his oar. In doing this,
he himself fell into the water, and would
certainly have been drowned had not the
dog, as soon as he saw his master struggling
in the stream, suffered the boat to
float away, and held him above water, till
assistance arrived, and his life was saved.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Prognostics of the Weather.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> is a matter of great convenience, to
be able to tell, beforehand, what the
weather is to be. Some persons rely
upon the Almanac, but let me tell you
that anybody can guess at the weather,
as well as an Almanac-maker. There
are certain signs, however, which foretell
changes of weather, many of which
have been noticed for thousands of years.

<p>Thus persons who follow the sea, learn
to predict, with great certainty, what the
weather will be for some time to come.
Farmers, and other people also, who live
in the country, where the business depends
much upon the weather, get to
understand the signs which foretell a
change with tolerable accuracy.</p>

<p>In order to enable the reader to study
the subject of signs of the weather, I
will arrange those most relied upon, in
alphabetical order, for convenient reference;
remarking by the way, that “all
signs of rain are said to fail in dry
weather.” By this you must understand
that the signs here set down are only
probable, not infallible, signs.</p>

<p><i>Aches and Pains</i> in the body, of various
kinds, frequently forebode rain. Persons,
for example, subject to rheumatism,
feel more pain in the affected limb or part
of the body before a change of weather,
particularly when fair is to be exchanged
for wet. Old, carious teeth are also
troublesome, and pains in the face, ears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
and gums are sometimes experienced.
Limbs once broken also ache at the place
of their union, and various other aches
and pains have been from time immemorial
found to be signs of changes of
the weather.</p>

<p><i>Animals</i>, by some peculiar sensibility
to electrical or other atmospheric influence,
often indicate changes of weather
by their peculiar motions and habits.</p>

<p><i>Ants.</i>—An universal bustle and activity
observed in ant hills may be generally
regarded as a sign of rain. The
ants frequently appear all in motion
together and carry their eggs about from
place to place.</p>

<p><i>Asses.</i>—When asses bray more than
ordinary, particularly if they shake their
ears as if uneasy, it is said they predict
rain, and particularly showers. We have
noticed, that, in showery weather, a donkey,
confined in a yard near the house, has
brayed before every shower, and generally
some minutes before the rain has
fallen, as if some electrical influence,
produced by the concentrating power of
the approaching rain-cloud, caused a
tickling in the windpipe of the animal,
just before the shower came up. Whatever
this electric state of the air preceding
a shower may be, it seems to be the
same that causes in other animals some
peculiar sensations,—which makes the
peacock squall the pintado call “come-back,”
and which creates a variety of
prognosticative motions in the different
species of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>An expressive English adage says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1">When that the ass begins to bray,</div>
    <div class="i1">Be sure we shall have rain that day.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>We have, says the writer of the preceding,
repeatedly been able to give our
hay-makers useful admonitions founded
solely on the braying of the ass. Thus
the proverb says truly,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1">’Tis time to cock your hay and corn</div>
    <div class="i1">When the old donkey blows his horn.</div>

<p><i>Barometer.</i>—There is no instrument
now more generally used for ascertaining
the coming weather than the barometer.
It may however be remarked, that it is
more from its rising or falling, than from
its height or lowness, that we are to infer
fair or foul weather. Generally speaking,
the rising of the mercury presages
clear fair weather, and its falling, foul
weather, as rain, snow, high winds, and
storms.</p>

<p>In very hot weather, the falling of the
mercury indicates thunder.</p>

<p>In winter, the rising indicates frost, and
in frosty weather, if the mercury fall
three or four divisions, there will follow
a thaw; but in a continued frost, if the
mercury rise, it will snow.</p>

<p>When foul weather happens soon after
the falling of the mercury, expect but
little of it; and, on the contrary, expect
but little fair weather when it proves fair
shortly after the mercury has risen.</p>

<p>In foul weather, when the mercury
rises much and high, and so continues
for two or three days before the foul
weather is quite over, then expect a continuance
of fair weather to follow.</p>

<p>In fair weather, when the mercury
falls much and low, and thus continues
for two or three days before the rain
comes, then expect a great deal of wet,
and probably high winds.</p>

<p>The unsettled motion of the mercury
denotes uncertain and changeable weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
The words engraved on the register
plate of the barometer, it may be observed,
cannot be strictly relied upon to correspond
exactly with the state of the
weather; though it will in general agree
with them as to the mercury rising and
falling.</p>

<p>When the thermometer and barometer
rise together in summer, with rain in
large drops, a wholesome state of the
atmosphere is at hand.</p>

<p>A great and sudden rising of the barometer,
that is to say, a great accession
of atmospherical pressure, will, in some
persons, occasion a slight temporary difficulty
of hearing and tingling in the
ears, similar to that which is experienced
in descending from high mountains, or
from the air in balloons.</p>

<p><i>Bats.</i>—When bats return soon to their
hiding places, and send forth loud cries,
bad weather may be expected.</p>

<p><i>Beetles</i> flying about late in an evening
often foretell a fine day on the morrow.</p>

<p><i>Blue Sky.</i>—When there is a piece of
blue sky seen in the forenoon of a rainy
day, big enough, as the proverb says, “to
make a Dutchman a pair of breeches,”
we shall probably have a fine afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Calm.</i>—A dead calm often precedes a
violent gale; and sometimes the calmest
and clearest mornings, in certain seasons,
are followed by a blowing showery day.
Calms are forerunners of the hurricanes
of the West Indies, and other tropical
climes.</p>

<p><i>Candles</i>, as well as lamps, often afford
good prognostics of weather. When the
flames of candles flare and snap, or burn
with an unsteady or dim light, rain, and
frequently wind also, are found to follow.
The excrescences from the wicks called
funguses also denote rain and wind.</p>

<p><i>Cats</i> are said, when they wash their
faces, or when they seem sleepy and
dull, to foretell rain. The same is said
of them when they appear irritable and
restless, and play with their tails.</p>

<p><i>Cattle</i>, when they gambol about in
their pastures more than ordinary, foreshow
rain, and in general a change of
weather.</p>

<p><i>Chilliness</i>, and a sensation of cold
greater than the indication of temperature
by the thermometer leads us to expect,
often forebode rain, as they show
that there is already an increased moisture
in the air, which experience has
shown to be referable to the decomposition
and the first formation of cloud.</p>

<p><i>Clouds</i> of any sort, when they increase
much, portend rain, particularly at eventide;
when they are very red they often
foreshow wind; when they form a dapple-gray
sky, with north wind, fair weather;
when they rapidly form and evaporate,
variable weather. Clouds, fretted and
spotted, covering the sky after fine weather,
or wavy, like the undulation of the
sea, forbode rain.</p>

<p><i>Colors</i>, of various kinds in the sky and
clouds, tokens severally of different phenomena.
Much red always forebodes
wind and rain, particularly in the morning;
in the evening it sometimes indicates
a fine day, particularly if the morning
be gray. A proverb says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1">An evening red and a morning gray</div>
    <div class="i1">Will set the traveller on his way;</div>
    <div class="i1">But an evening gray and a morning red</div>
    <div class="i1">Will pour down rain on the pilgrim’s head.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>A greenish color of the sky near to
the horizon, often shows that we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
expect more wet weather. The most
beautiful and varied tints are seen in
autumn, and in that season the purple
of the falling leaf is often a sign of a
continuation of fine weather.</p>

<p>When the clouds become more colored
than ordinary, and particularly when red
prevails, it sometimes indicates an east
wind.</p>

<p><i>Cocks</i>, when they crow at unwonted
hours, often foretell a change of weather.
We have often noticed this before rain.
But this is by no means so certain a sign
as many others; because, at particular
seasons, and in particular kinds of
weather, cocks habitually crow all day.
During the calm, still, dry, dark, and
warm weather sometimes occurring in
the winter months, and which may be
called the halcyon days of our climate,
cocks keep a constant crowing all night
and day. There appear to be three principal
cock crowings in ordinary weather,
namely, about midnight or soon after,
about three in the morning, and at daybreak;
the latter is never omitted.</p>

<p>We have noticed, however, that when
cocks crow all day, in summer particularly,
a change to rain has frequently
followed.</p>

<p><i>Cream and Milk</i>, when they turn sour
in the night, often indicate thereby that
thunder storms will probably shortly take
place. The effect is referable to the electricity
of the air at the time.</p>

<p><i>Currents of Air</i> change their course
frequently in the higher regions of the
air first, and are afterwards continued to
the earth’s surface; hence we can often
foresee a change of the wind by observing
the way in which the clouds above
move. Both the strength of a coming
gale, and the point of the compass from
which it will blow, may usually be foreseen
some time beforehand by noticing
the velocity and direction of the clouds
floating along in the upper current, or by
means of balloons.</p>

<p><i>Dolphins or porpoises</i>, when they come
about a ship, and sport and gambol on
the surface of the water, betoken a storm;
hence they are regarded as unlucky
omens for sailors. According to ancient
fable, they formerly offered themselves in
times of storm to convey shipwrecked
mariners to the shore; but this is, of
course, a story of mere human invention.</p>

<p><i>Dogs</i>, before rain, grow sleepy and
dull, and lie drowsily before the fire, and
are not easily aroused. They also often
eat grass, which indicates that their stomachs,
like ours, are apt to be disturbed
before a change of weather. It is also
said to be a sign of change of weather
when dogs howl and bark much in the
night; they certainly do this much at
the full moon, which has given rise to
the saying relative to the <i>dogs that bay
at the moon</i>. Dogs also dig in the earth
with their feet before rain, and often
make deep holes in the ground.</p>

<p><i>Dreams</i> of a hurrying and frightful
nature, also incubus, and other symptoms
of oppressed and imperfect sleep, are frequent
indications that the weather is
changed or about to change. Many persons
experience these nocturnal symptoms
on a change of wind, particularly
when it becomes east. In all these cases
the effect seems to be produced immediately
on the nervous system, and through
it on the stomach, so that the stomach
shall again re-act on the sensorium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p><i>Drains</i>, and sespools smell stronger
than usual before rain.</p>

<p><i>Drowsiness</i> and heavy sleep, both in
men and animals, often forebode a heavy
fall of rain or snow.</p>

<p><i>Ducks.</i>—The loud and clamorous
quackings of ducks, geese, and other
waterfowl, are signs of rain. It is also
a sign of rain when they wash themselves,
and flutter about in the water
more than usual.</p>

<p><i>Ears</i>, when there is a tingling noise,
or what is called a singing in them, afford
thereby a sign of a change of weather,
not simply of rain, as has been said,
but of barometrical pressure in general.
The sudden increase of pressure, like
the descent from high mountains, or from
balloons, causes in many persons a temporary
deafness and roaring in the ears.</p>

<p><i>Feathers</i>, pieces of flue, or dry leaves,
playing about on the surface of ponds
and other waters, as if agitated by light
and varying eddies of wind, often forebode
rain.</p>

<p><i>Fishes</i>, when they bite more readily,
and gambol near the surface of the
streams or ponds, foreshow rain.</p>

<p><i>Flowers</i> are many of them excellent
indicators of the approaching weather by
their opening and shutting, and other
motions.</p>

<p><i>Fleeces, and Mares’ Tails</i>, as they are
called, seen in the sky, are signs of rain
and wind. By fleeces are meant those
clouds which look like fleeces of wool.</p>

<p><i>Flies</i>, and various sorts of volatile insects,
become more troublesome, and sting
and bite more than usual before, as well
as in the intervals of rainy weather, particularly
in autumn, when they are very
numerous, and often become a great nuisance.
This observation applies to several
sorts of flies. The horse-flies likewise
of all sorts are more troublesome
before the fall of rain, and particularly
when the weather is warm.</p>

<p><i>Forests.</i>—The hollow sound of forests,
while the wind is roaring among the
woods, is a sign of rain and of storms.</p>

<p><i>Geese</i> washing, or taking wing with a
clamorous noise, and flying to the water,
portend rain. Geese, by the way, are
excellent guards to a house against fire or
thieves.</p>

<p><i>Gnats</i> afford several indications.—When
they fly in a vortex in the beams
of the setting sun, they forebode fair
weather: when they frisk about more
widely in the open air at eventide, they
foreshow heat; and when they assemble
under trees, and bite more than usual,
they indicate rain.</p>

<p><i>Halo.</i>—When this phenomenon is observed
round the sun or moon, it shows
that hail, snow, or rain, according to the
season, will soon follow. Colored or
double halos are still more certain indications
of rain, and often of wind also.
When mock suns or mock moons, bands
of light, and other unusual phenomena
attend halos, a peculiar condition of the
atmosphere is indicated. The proper
<span class="dfn">halo</span> or luminous ring, is distinguished
from the <span class="dfn">corona</span> or luminous disk, which
is sometimes a forerunner of rain also,
but is a thing of more frequent occurrence.
When halos are very red, wind
almost always follows.</p>

<p><i>Headaches</i> often foretell a change of
weather in persons subject to such complaints.
There is also some obscure
change of weather near to the periods
of new and full moon, which causes a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
certain ephemeral headache that begins
usually in the morning, gets worse about
two o’clock, and subsides in the evening,
attended with an irritated stomach; it
much resembles the ordinary bilious
headache from repletion, but differs from
that which follows immediately on a certain
sort of indigestion. Indeed, most
periodical disorders seem to be connected
with some atmospheric changes. And
it is very remarkable, that they should
so often have their worst paroxysms and
the crisis of their terms, about the time
of the conjunction and the opposition of
the moon.</p>

<p><i>Hogs</i>, when they shake the stalks of
corn and spoil them, often indicate rain:
also when they rub in the dust, the same
or some similar phenomenon may be expected.
When they run squeaking about,
and throw up their heads with a peculiar
jerk, windy weather is about to commence:
hence the Wiltshire proverb,
that “Pigs can see the wind.”</p>

<p><i>Horses</i>, as well as some other domestic
animals, foretell the coming of rain by
starting more than ordinary, and appearing
in other respects restless and uneasy
on the road.</p>

<p><i>Incubus</i> or nightmare, though it commonly
comes of a loaded stomach, will
nevertheless often occur on the occasion
of a change of weather in the night,
which seems to produce the effect by disturbing
the digestive organs. The same
observation holds good with regard to
those frightful and impressive dreams
which some persons have in particular
kinds of weather, and about the period
of change.</p>

<p><i>Lamps</i>, from the manner in which they
burn, forebode change of weather. Before
rain they burn less bright, the flame
snaps and crackles, and a sort of fungous
excrescence grows from the wicks, which
Virgil was mindful to put among his
prognostics of rain and wind.</p>

<p><i>Mare’s Tails</i>, or cormoid curlclouds in
the sky, forebode wind, and sometimes
rain.</p>

<p><i>Moon.</i>—The prognostics from the looks
of the moon are various, and were known
of old. When she looks fiery, or red,
like the color of copper, wind is generally
to be suspected; when pale, or confused
with ill-defined edges, rain; when
very clear and bright, fine weather.</p>

<p>When the moon is near the full, or new,
people are more irritable than at other
times, and headaches and diseases of
various kinds are worse. Insanity at
these times has its worst paroxysms, and
hence the origin of the term lunacy.
Timber cut in the last quarter of the
moon is said to be much the most durable.
About the time of full moon the
weather is generally fair. The changes
of the moon are supposed to bring
changes of weather.</p>

<p>Thus we have given a chapter upon
signs, and, although they are not all to
be relied upon, they may be worthy of
notice.</p>

<p>How changed is the aspect of everything
around us! The trees have put off
their garments; the flowers have perished;
the green grass is withered and
dead. How silent is the forest! Of all
the merry songsters that made it ring

Even the partridge and the quail

even children admire them, and
to form a bouquet seems to be almost
as natural as to put food into the
mouth. The Indians of Mexico, barbarians
as they were in many things, were
passionately fond of flowers. Even to
this day you may see, in the city of Mexico,
the Indians, reduced to a state of
poverty and degradation, still retaining
the passion which marked them in the
days of Montezuma. In their stalls
where they sell fruits and vegetables,
they seem almost smothered with flowers,
which are every day renewed.</p>

<p>But there is an interest in flowers
beyond their mere beauty. However
graceful their forms, however charming
their colors, or sweet their perfume,
there is still more pleasure to be derived
from the study of them in respect
to their botanical characters, their formation,
their mode of propagation, &amp;c. A
person, in looking over a meadow, might
fancy that all was confusion, but if he
will investigate the subject, he will soon
discover that all these various plants can
be grouped into certain families, bearing
the most curious and interesting relations
to each other.</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, too earnestly recommend
the scientific study of plants
to our young readers. It is not only an
innocent and pleasing pursuit—it not
only leads to much useful knowledge,
but it lifts the heart in admiration to that
great and good Being, who, in providing
for the wants of his creatures, has mingled
beauty and pleasure with almost
every cup of life.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">e</span> continued our journey with great
industry, generally travelling about
forty miles a day. My Indian guide
had the usual taciturnity of his
race, but occasionally he entered into
conversation, and I then discovered that
he had led a life of adventure, and possessed
the happy talent of describing
what he had seen. I had by this time
acquired a knowledge of the Spanish
language, and I therefore found his narratives
quite a resource during the tedious
hours during which we seemed to be
creeping like snails over the almost
interminable plain.</p>

<p>He had frequently officiated before as
a guide over the road we were now travelling,
and he gave me an account of
several occurrences in which he had
taken part, which might have graced the
pages of romance.</p>

<p>It appears that the Pampas are inhabited
by a peculiar race of men, called
Gauchos. These are the descendants of
Spaniards of wild and irregular character,
who had fled from civilized society
and settled upon the plains, subsisting
almost entirely by hunting and rearing
cattle. The son followed the vocation of
the father, and thus several succeeding
generations of hunters had been scattered
over these prairies. At the time of which
I am speaking, they consisted of considerable
numbers of people, though they
lived apart from each other in families,
dwelling in small huts, and spending the
greater part of their time on horseback.
These men generally respected travellers,
but occasionally they would take to
the highway and commit desperate acts
of robbery.</p>

<p>There were small bands of Indians,
also, whose homes were along the southern
borders of the Pampas, but possessing
fleet horses, they occasionally made incursions
even into remote portions of the
plains, and after having struck a sudden
blow upon some unprotected family, they
would speed to another and another,
marking their route with blood and conflagration.
Of these wild and savage
people, my guide told me various anecdotes.
I have not space to recount them,
but in order to give an idea of the scenes
which are constantly occurring in this
remote region of the world, I will repeat
one of the tales which he told me.</p>

<p>A few years previous to the period of
which I am speaking, a wealthy Spanish
gentleman, with his daughter about eighteen
years of age, was travelling from
Chili to Buenos Ayres. They were in a
carriage drawn by four horses, and were
attended by several servants, two of
whom were on horseback. One night,
as they were passing through a thicket
of tall grass, a terrible cry burst upon
their ears, and at the same moment about
a dozen savages sprung from their lurking
places, and immediately assailed the
travelling party. The servants who were
armed discharged their pistols, but they
were speedily torn from their horses; the
coachman was knocked from his seat,
and the two post-boys in their fright ran
away. The gentleman in the coach
threw open the door and rushed out; but
at the moment, he was laid prostrate, by
a blow, upon the earth.</p>

<p>Frightened at the sounds around them,
the horses in the carriage began to rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
and plunge, and then, suddenly springing
forward, ran with all their might. In a
few moments, they were lost to the view,
but the rattling of the wheels was heard
for a time, and was then suddenly terminated
by a heavy and crashing sound.</p>

<p>The pockets of the travellers were
soon rifled, and the Indians then departed
in pursuit of the coach, leaving two
of the servants who had been engaged
in the fray dead upon the spot, and the
Spanish gentleman himself stunned by
the blows he had received.</p>

<p>At the distance of two miles, the savages
found the coach overturned, and
reduced to a mere wreck. The young
lady within, overcome with terror, was
in a state of insensibility. Being taken
out, she was speedily restored. The
coach was then rifled, and the lady being
placed on horseback before one of the
savages, the party pushed forward across
the prairie in a southerly direction.</p>

<p>In the course of four days, they reached
their settlements, and the young lady,
whose name was Donna Marina, was
committed to the charge of a daughter
of one of the savage chiefs. Worn out
with fatigue and anxiety, she seemed at
first indifferent to her fate; but in the
course of a few days, having recovered
her health and spirits, she became desirous
of knowing the fate that awaited
her. She then learned that a messenger
was to be despatched to Buenos Ayres,
where, it was ascertained, her father had
arrived, proposing to surrender his daughter
for a ransom of 5000 dollars.</p>

<p>Understanding from the savage maiden
under whose care she was placed, that
no personal injury to herself was intended,
she became tolerably calm. But it
chanced that there was among the Indians
a fiery young warrior, whose father
was a Spaniard, his mother being an
Indian. He was born at one of the Spanish
huts in the vicinity of Buenos Ayres,
and in his early days had acquired a taste
for the refinements of civilized life. But
his natural daring and love of adventure
had led him to join the wild inhabitants
of the Pampas, among whom he had
now become a celebrated leader.</p>

<p>At this period, he was in the bloom
of early manhood, and was remarkable
alike for the symmetry of his form, the
grace of his movements, and the manly
beauty of his countenance. Among the
women of the tribe, he was an object of
universal regard, on account of his fine
appearance, and even the stern old warriors
could not withhold their admiration
at his achievements in the foray and the
field. Thus an object of universal adulation,
it may well be supposed that the
young warrior, whose name was Yorika,
had a pretty high estimate of himself.
He was not of the party who had captured
the fair Marina; but when he heard
of the beauty of the maiden, he sought an
opportunity to see her. His wishes were
easily gratified by means of a little flattery
bestowed upon her keeper. Vanity
had led the youthful Indian to seek the
interview, but a deeper sentiment led him
frequently to renew it.</p>

<p>The beauty of the captive stole into
his heart, and doubtless, her gentle manners
awakened his recollections of scenes
that had been familiar in his childhood.
At all events, he was deeply enamored
of the Spanish maiden, and did not hesitate
to avow his passion. His overtures,
however, were sternly repelled; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
stung to the quick, the fiery savage determined
to obtain by force the maiden
he could not win by affection.</p>

<p>During these events, the messenger
had communicated with the father of
Donna Marina at Buenos Ayres, and
brought a favorable answer to the proposition
of ransom. In two days a gentleman
was to arrive at a designated point
to pay the required sum and receive the
captive. Preparations were immediately
made to carry the treaty into effect, and
in due time four men were despatched
with Donna Marina to meet the Spanish
agent. Yorika had been designated as
one of this party, but he excused himself,
seeming to disdain a service which
offered so little of enterprize or adventure.</p>

<p>The party set forward, and at the place
of meeting found the person whom they
expected, already in attendance. The
negotiation was speedily settled, the money
paid and the captive surrendered.
The savages, and the Spanish maiden,
now under the charge of her affianced
lover, also departed. The latter were
mounted on horseback, and by the light
of a summer moon they made their way
across the plain. Rejoicing in their reunion
after the distressing events which
had transpired, they rode side by side,
their hearts being often too full for utterance.</p>

<p>At length their path led them into a
shallow vale thickly overgrown with wild
thistles. As they were passing through
this, a pistol was fired, and a ball whizzed
near the breast of the attendant of Donna
Marina. A moment after, the athletic
form of Yorika rose from the thicket and
sprung like a lion upon the object at
which his pistol had been aimed. The
Spaniard was immediately pulled from
his horse, and a desperate conflict ensued.
The superior strength of the Indian, however,
prevailed, and he soon pressed the
form of his antagonist beneath him. He
drew his dirk, and was about to plunge
it into the breast of his foe.</p>

<p>At that critical instant, the Spaniard
brought his pistol to bear, and discharging
it in the breast of the Indian, laid
him prostrate upon the earth. Bruised
and bleeding, he rose from the ground
and made his way to Marina. At first,
the girl shrunk back with horror, imagining
that it was the victorious Yorika,
who had come to claim her as his own.
But when her reason was restored, and
she learned the truth, she expressed her
joy and gratitude alike for the safety of
her lover and her own.</p>

<p>Such was one of the tales of my guide,
which beguiled the weariness of our
journey over the Pampas. He related
several narratives respecting the jaguar,
which is a kind of tiger infesting the
thickets which border upon the road.
One day, as we were passing through an
immense forest of thistles, ten feet in
height, and spreading out like an interminable
sea on every side, he pointed to
a spot where a traveller, on descending
from his horse, had been seized and torn
in pieces by one of these furious beasts.</p>

<p>Day after day, we continued our monotonous
course. Although it was winter,
the weather by no means answered
to the common idea of that season. We
had occasional rain, but it was seldom
colder than during our April or May.
Few incidents occurred to break the uniformity
of our journey. One day appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
like another, and as we had no objects
by which we could mark our progress,
we seemed, like a ship in the waste of
waters, to stand still in the midst of the
shoreless desert. As we stood alone
upon the bosom of the mighty prairie,
stretching out on every side, and blending
itself with the sky, we seemed dwindled
into insects. Never have I felt such
a sense of nothingness as in the presence
of that mighty plain. In measuring myself
by the gigantic scale which the
Pampas presented, it seemed that I might
be blotted from existence like the veriest
moth that fluttered in the breeze. It was
not until I turned my mind upon my
plans and prospects, my hopes and fears,
that my bosom began to swell again with
those powerful emotions which seem to
give importance to our existence and
enable us to triumph over the despondency
which often besets the heart, and
might otherwise sink us in despair.</p>

<p>The sense of loneliness, the yearning
for society, the longing to be restored to
the sympathy of human beings which
beset one in these solitudes, can only be
understood by experience. I doubtless
felt these the more from my youth and
the want of that stern habit of self-reliance
which is acquired by men who
pursue a life of hazard and adventure.
But I was becoming trained in the school
of experience, and day by day was
learning to sustain myself with my own
thoughts, plans and prospects.</p>

<p>We met few travellers upon the road.
Four men on horseback, and a company
with two vehicles, were all that we encountered
in a distance of more than 500
miles. The latter consisted of some five
and twenty persons. They had a baggage
cart, which was a capacious, rude
uncouth-looking vehicle, with cane sides
and a roof covered with hides. The body
was balanced upon two prodigiously high
wheels for the convenience of passing
through rivers. The other vehicle was a
long coach, called a <span class="dfn">galera</span>, and resembled
the modern omnibus; the seats ran
sideways, and the door was at the end.
To each of these carriages there were
four horses, and a postilion to each
horse. Such is the ordinary equipment
of travellers upon the Pampas.</p>

<p>The post houses upon the road were
miserable tenements, generally of mud,
and affording scanty accommodation.
The lazy inhabitants seem to offer
the commonest civility with reluctance
or languid indifference. We occasionally
met with huts inhabited by squalid
Indians, who seemed sunk in indolence
and apathy. They were nearly naked,
yet they possessed a gentle and kindly
character. The herds of cattle upon the
plains furnish them abundance of meat,
and they parted with it freely, seeming
to be almost indifferent whether they
received compensation or not.</p>

<p>At the end of twenty days, we reached
the verge of the Pampas, and now began
to ascend the highlands, which rise by
gradations for the distance of nearly two
hundred miles, at the foot of the Andes.
Industriously pursuing our journey, we
rose step by step, and at last reached
a village situated in a deep gorge at the
foot of mountains that seemed to reach
the skies. Here we sold our horses, and
purchased mules, these animals being
considered safer in climbing the dizzy
precipices, over which our road now lay.</p>

<p>Being duly equipped, and having rested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
three days, we departed and began to
creep up the frowning battlements of the
Andes. Sometimes we seemed lost in
deep and dark ravines; sometimes we
threaded our way amid rocks that lifted
their shaggy pinnacles over our heads,
which seemed to threaten us with destruction,
and sometimes, we reached a
lofty peak from which we could see the
rugged valley stretched out behind, and
still loftier pinnacles rising up to the
heavens in front. How striking the contrast
between these savage mountains
and the level prairie!—yet the emotions
they excited were nearly the same; the
same overpowering sense of vastness in
nature; the same oppressive sense of
my own insignificance, visited me here
as upon the Pampas. There was, indeed,
something exhilarating in the mountain
air, and the consciousness of danger
frequently experienced as we wound
along the edges of the mountains with a
yawning chasm of five hundred feet
below, imparted something of a romantic
interest to our journey. The scenery,
too, was often amazingly grand, and when
at last we reached the highest ridge of
the Andes, and I gazed upon its glittering
peaks covered with everlasting snow, I
experienced a sensation which I shall
never forget. They seemed indeed like
bluish-white clouds piled up to the very
heavens. They appeared like the ghosts
of mountains, dreamy and mist-like,
rather than those eternal barriers of snow-capped
granite which they really are.</p>

<p>Winding for several days along the
devious path, amid the wilderness of
rocky peaks and cliffs, we began to
emerge from the labyrinth, and the western
slope of the Andes soon opened before
us. Creeping over a succession of
ridges, we finally reached the undulating
plain, and from an eminence, we caught a
distant view of the Pacific. Proceeding
through a country of great fertility we
arrived at the place of our destination,
thankful indeed that I had reached it in
safety.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr></p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">found</span> the city of Valparaiso to be
much smaller than its commercial importance
had led me to suppose. It is the
chief port on the western coast of America.
From this point, the principal commerce
is carried on with the Islands of
the Pacific and the coast of Asia. Indeed,
Valparaiso is the centre of trade in
this quarter of the world. Still, at the
time I was there, more than twenty years
ago, its population did not exceed 15,000.
In 1822, it suffered from a dreadful earthquake,
but it has now increased, and
since the independence of Chili, it has
become even more important than in former
times. It is built along a bending
beach, at the foot of a high bluff, which
overlooks the town. The buildings are
ornamented with piazzas, painted with
different colors, giving the place a very
lively appearance. The present number
of inhabitants is about 25,000.</p>

<p>It may well be believed that the business
which brought me to this place, engrossed
my thoughts, and that immediately
after my arrival, I began to devote
my attention to it. I delivered the letters
of introduction I had brought, and pursued
my enquiries in relation to my
uncle, in the channels which had been
pointed out. To my great mortification,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
I soon found that he was not in Valparaiso.</p>

<p>The only clue I could obtain which
seemed to offer the least chance of his
discovery, was that a man bearing the
Spanish name of Signor Morales, had
come to this city some fifteen years
before. He engaged in commerce, and
being a man of enterprise, was very successful,
and speedily amassed a large
estate. Suddenly, and without any known
cause, he became poor, closed his business
and lived a life of seclusion. At
last, he disappeared and no one seemed
to know with certainty whither he had
gone.</p>

<p>I found various rumors respecting him.
One person said he had gone to the Island
of Juan Fernandes, and now lived
there alone as Alexander Selkirk had
done before him. I was told by another
that he had become a friar, and lived
as a hermit near the foot of one of the
snow-capped mountains of the Andes.
Another story was, that the mysterious
merchant had gone to Potosi, where he
had purchased a silver mine and become
immensely rich.</p>

<p>Amid these various rumors, one thing
only seemed to be clear, and this was,
that the individual to whom they related
was in fact my uncle. The description
of his person, manners, and appearance
was exact. Everything else however
was uncertain. It seemed probable, indeed,
that he had himself set afloat the
contradictory rumors as to his residence,
with a view of concealing his real purpose.</p>

<p>I remained several months at Valparaiso,
following out every suggestion that
seemed to offer a clue to the object of my
search. At last there seemed some reason
to suppose that the story of my uncle’s
being at Potosi, was not altogether
without foundation. Faint, indeed, was
the hope thus offered, but in the absence
of every other, I determined to visit that
celebrated place. My guide across the
Pampas had continued with me and
again setting out on horseback, we laid
our course for southern Peru, a country
which is now known by the title of Bolivia.</p>

<p>The road led to the north, and lay at a
distance of sixty or seventy miles from
the ocean. For the most part we travelled
over a wavy table-land, nearly a
thousand feet above the level of the sea.
On our right, lay the mighty range of the
Andes; on our left, the almost boundless
Pacific. The country was thinly settled,
there being here and there a small village;
or, more frequently, the villa of
some Spanish planter. The country
was exceedingly fertile, and the cattle
seemed as abundant as upon the prairies
of Buenos Ayres. As we rode along,
the grass, now in its fullest bloom, frequently
concealed the pasturing herds
from view, and often as we rode along,
the coarse herbage seemed to form a
wall on either side of the path, rising
even as high as my head. Never have
I seen a more lovely climate, or a more
fruitful soil.</p>

<p>Though we met with few adventures,
our journey was delightful. In ten days
we approached the celebrated desert of
Atacama, which stretches four hundred
and fifty miles along the Pacific, and
forms the maritime district of the
present republic of Bolivia. Upon this
spot, as if it were deserted of Heaven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
the rain never falls, and it is accordingly
given up to everlasting blight and desolation.
It is a sandy waste, and is not
only destitute of vegetation, but it is said
that no animal, not even a spider, a
cricket, or a worm, is found throughout
its vast extent.</p>

<p>Our road, for two days, lay along the
verge of this waste. It seemed marked
with a peculiar aspect of solitude and
desertion. No word can express the
emotions which it suggested, but that of
<em>death</em>. Neither life, nor motion, nor verdure
were visible throughout its measureless
bosom. No sound seemed to stir
the atmosphere, in that region of silence.
I paused as we rode over its surface; and
such was the absolute void of nature—such
the settled silence of the very atmosphere—that
I felt oppressed, and moved
forward to throw off a feeling that my
heart would cease to beat in the midst
of this pulseless creation.</p>

<p>Taking leave of the desert, our course
turned more to the eastward, and we
began to enter a more mountainous territory.
One evening, as the sun went
down, we saw before us a lofty peak,
covered with snow. From its top, issued
a perpendicular column of dark smoke,
which, at the elevation of a few hundred
feet, expanded into a thin cloud. Its
shape was that of a pine tree, divested
of branches, except at the top.</p>

<p>We knew this mountain to be a volcano,
and we gazed upon it with intense
interest. We soon arrived at a small
village, and took up our lodgings for the
night. Being greatly fatigued, I retired
early to bed, and was speedily wrapped
in profound repose. I was at length
awaked by a violent shaking, and the
most terrific sounds I ever heard. I
sprang out of bed, and rushed to the
window. The whole heavens seemed to
be on fire, and as I caught a view of the
volcanic peak, I perceived that it was
vomiting forth torrents of lava, smoke
and flame. The inhabitants of the village
were already in the street, and
seemed to be frantic with alarm, if not
despair. I hurried on my clothes, and
descended also to the street.</p>

<p>The volcano was in full blast, rumbling
to its foundation, and keeping up at
its mouth a roaring sound, like the continued
discharge of artillery. Amid the
columns of black smoke that rose to the
sky, hundreds of rocks, red with heat,
seemed shot upward, like blazing rockets,
while the molten lava—a river of fire—was
seen pouring over the edge of the
crater, and making its way toward the
village. But this was not the greatest
danger. The thick masses of snow and
ice, around the peak of the crater, were
melted, and roaring torrents were already
bursting down the declivity.</p>

<p>The confused sound of the raging
waters was audible, even amid the thunder
that shook the fabric of the mountains.
The valley was situated in a
gorge, through which the river must pour
its flood. Conscious of the peril, the
people were preparing for flight. But
the danger was even more near at hand
than was anticipated. While I stood
gazing at the sublime pinnacle of the
volcano, I heard a rush at a little distance,
and suddenly I perceived the tumbling
waters gushing between the houses and
filling the narrow street. Most of the
people had already fled, and I followed
in their train. <a id="chg9"></a>Scarcely had we reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
a rocky eminence on the side of an adjacent
ridge, when the whole village was
engulphed, and speedily swept away.</p>

<p>So sudden had been the alarm, so
rapid our retreat, that I had not saved a
single article, except the clothes upon my
back. My own horse, as well as that of
my guide, with every particle of baggage,
money, papers, letters—every vestige
was swallowed up by the inundation;
I was even uncertain of the fate of
my guide, till at last I discovered him,
half wild with terror, amid the throng
that had now gathered upon the cliff.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the night the
volcano remained in violent agitation,
and the swollen torrent of water continued
to flow down its side and sweep
over the buried village. One by one,
the people departed to seek shelter at a
small town about two miles distant, and
when morning came, finding no hope of
recovering my horse or baggage, I followed
the rest, and took up my lodgings
at the post-house.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> situation was now in the highest
degree embarrassing and painful. I was
at least three hundred miles from Potosi,
and excepting a small piece of gold, and
a few dollars in silver, which I happened
to have in my pocket, in all amounting
to about seven dollars, I was absolutely
destitute of money. I was in the midst
of strangers, and had no means of obtaining
credit, by which I might repair
my losses. I spent two or three days in
walking up and down the river, which
had swept away our horses and baggage;
but the torrent continued to increase, rather
than subside, and had now the aspect
of a permanent river. Not the slightest
hope was therefore presented of retrieving
our fortunes. No other alternative
was offered but to make our way to
Potosi on foot.</p>

<p>No sooner was my resolution taken
than I departed, still accompanied by
Balbo, my Indian guide. When I was
once again in action, my spirits rose, and
with a cheerful heart I pursued my way
over the rugged country that lay before
me. For several days, the tall pyramidal
top of the smoking volcano was in view,
and indeed, as we proceeded, it seemed
to lift its head above the surrounding
mountains as if to watch us, or to keep
us company. It was not till we had
travelled a distance of more than forty
miles, that it began to dwindle in the distance,
and sink down amid the mountain
peaks that encircled it.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful season, and on every
side, there were objects to attract my
attention. The strange but gorgeous
flowers that were scattered in profusion
on every hand; the gaudy birds; the
contrast between the mountain scenery
on one side, and the waving plain, marked
with cultivation, on the other, afforded
constant topics for observation and reflection.
No very remarkable incidents occurred,
yet there were passages in our
journey which were by no means devoid
of interest. We met with no towns, and
few villages.</p>

<p>The Indians constituted the chief inhabitants
upon the route. These were
marked with a peculiar character of
gentleness, and their hospitality was unbounded.
They allowed us freely to
share in whatever food they possessed,
and would seldom accept of payment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Their houses were of the simplest materials,
consisting of poles set upright in
the ground, the sides and roof being
firmly thatched with palm leaves. Their
furniture was rude and scanty. They
seemed to sail down the stream of life,
resigning themselves with easy indolence
to its current. They had most of them
some cattle, and milk furnished a leading
article of their food.</p>

<p>In one instance, we met with an exciting
adventure. As we were crossing
a broken range of mountains, we perceived
a small animal, resembling a deer,
pursued by a bird of enormous size. My
guide immediately informed me that the
quadruped was a vicuna, and that the
pursuer was a species of vulture, which
is familiar to most readers under the name
of condor. When we first saw them,
the vicuna was straining every nerve to
escape, while the condor hung over his
back, and at every opportunity struck his
talons into his flesh.</p>

<p>They both swept by us, so close that
we could distinctly see every feature of
the pursuer and pursued. The little
quadruped was foaming at the mouth;
his eye was wild and glaring, and his
sides streaming with blood. The vulture,
with his merciless gaze fixed upon his
prey, held his talons ready for the blow,
while he seemed to glance through the
air on his outspread wings, like an arrow
from the bow. On they went, till at last
the vicuna came to a precipice of nearly
two hundred feet in depth. Pressed by
his remorseless enemy, he hesitated not
for a moment, but taking the fatal leap,
fell crushed and lifeless into the depths
of the rocky gorge beneath. The condor
wheeled round and round, and finally
stooped with an easy motion to partake
of his feast.</p>

<p>I had some curiosity to see the monster
at his meal. After winding round
for a considerable distance, we reached
the bottom of the ravine. We approached
the savage bird, and perceived that he had
already commenced his feast; he had
torn open the bowels of the vicuna, and
seemed to cut and rend the flesh with his
enormous beak as easily as if it had been
a butcher’s knife. As we drew near,
he glared upon us fiercely, and seemed
to deliberate for a moment whether he
should not repel the unwelcome intrusion.
Finding us not disposed to retreat, he
seized his prey in his claws, and beating
his wings with a furious impulse rose
heavily upon the air. Bending his course
slightly downward along the distant slope
of the mountains, he continued for some
time in view, and at last disappeared
amid the mazes of the forest.</p>

<p>Pursuing our way with diligence, we
now began to ascend the mountains which
encircled the valley of Potosi. Winding
our way through deep vales, and often
climbing along the dizzy edges of beetling
cliffs, we reached the top of the
mountain range and looked down upon
the scene below. The wild and rugged
ramparts which encircle this famous
city, bear a desolate and wintry aspect.
Scarcely a tree crowns their summits, and
nothing but mosses and lichens seem to
flourish in the chill and ungenial climate.
Yet below, we could perceive bright
patches of vegetation, seeming to indicate
a milder temperature.</p>

<p>Beginning now to descend, we proceeded
with caution, and were soon lodged
in the celebrated city of Potosi.</p>

<p class="center ls">CHAPTER <abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I proceed with my narrative, I
must give some little account of the celebrated
town in which I now found
myself. Potosi is situated within a circle
of mountains, and stands at the foot of a
lofty peak which rises far above the rest.
In this are the rich mines of silver which
have given such fame to the place.</p>

<p>The number of inhabitants in Potosi
was once 100,000, but it has greatly
diminished, and the present number does
not exceed 15,000; half of these are
Indians. The towns of South America
are not famous for their neatness; in
this respect, however, Potosi has the
advantage over most other cities in this
quarter of the world. It is the custom
to whitewash the houses on the outside,
which gives them a very cheerful aspect.</p>

<p>Potosi is very remarkable in several
respects. In the morning the air is
keen and cold, but in the middle of the
day it is burning hot. At night, the
cold returns, and it seems almost as
chill as during our New England March.
Potosi is situated at an elevation of
13,265 feet above the level of the sea,
and is the highest inhabited place on the
face of the globe.</p>

<p>After my arrival here, my first business
was to despatch letters to my
friends at Valparaiso for a supply of
money, and letters of introduction. I
then sallied forth to take a view of the
town. On my return I stated the manner
in which I had lost my baggage to
the landlord of the hotel, and having
informed him that I had come on important
business, requested him to supply
me with such articles as I needed till I
could obtain remittances. The man
looked in my face with a gaze of amazement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and then laughed outright at what
he deemed my brazen impudence.</p>

<p>I was, in fact, miserably clad, and my
servant was worse off than myself. We
looked, indeed, like a couple of vagabonds,
and though I was at first angry,
I did not think the conduct of the landlord
unreasonable when I reflected upon
the whole matter. But what was to be
done? I was out of money and totally
unknown to everybody in the place. It
was necessary to do something for immediate
support, and I therefore determined
that my guide, Balbo, should go
to work in the mines if I could get him
a place, hoping that he would obtain the
means of subsistence for us both.</p>

<p>Everybody has heard how the silver
mines of Potosi were discovered. An
Indian hunter was pursuing a vicuna up
the slope of the mountain. In order to
aid his ascent, he seized upon a small
tree. This gave way, and beneath its
roots, he saw a shining mass of silver.
This occurred three hundred years ago,
and since that time, more than a thousand
millions of dollars have been taken from
the mines in the mountain where this
accidental discovery was made.</p>

<p>I had heard the story of the Indian
hunter, and fancied that silver in Potosi
was almost as abundant as common
earth. When I reached the mines, however,
I found the fact to be otherwise.
The openings to these mines are small
holes, which are entered by getting down
upon the hands and knees. In this
manner, you crawl along for a number
of yards, when the space widens, and you
are able to stand upright. There are a
great many of these shafts, and some of
them penetrate to a considerable distance
into the bowels of the mountain. The
silver ore is found in veins, and in following
these, the miners have wrought
out irregular winding caverns, sometimes
ascending, and again descending. They
work by blasting the rock with gunpowder.
The ore, thus broken off, is carried
out in the leather aprons of the workmen.</p>

<p>Most persons have no other than
pleasant ideas in regard to silver; but if
they could see the miserable Indians
toiling in the mines, shut out from the
light of day, grimed with soot and gunpowder,
and haggard from the want of
pure air, and all to obtain this precious
metal, they would ever after feel that
even this is purchased at almost too dear
a rate.</p>

<p>I was not a little shocked and disgusted
to observe the severe and painful
toil required at the mines. After the ore
is obtained, it is broken into pieces about
the size of a hen’s egg. It is then put
into a mill, and reduced to powder. In
this state, it is mixed with salt and quicksilver,
and remains fifteen days. By
this time the silver has become mixed
with the quicksilver. The earthy particles
are then washed away, and the
silver is separated from the quicksilver
by squeezing. Such is the laborious
process of mining; yet, notwithstanding
the severe nature of the occupation, I
found the wages to be but fifteen cents a
day. The urgency of the case conquered
my feelings, and I agreed that Balbo
should go to work the next day.</p>

<p>This he accordingly did, and I found
that, by the utmost economy, we could
both of us subsist upon his earnings. I
was now at leisure to pursue my inquiries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
in relation to the object of my journey.
It is unnecessary to detail the
careful investigation that I made, or to
say with what anxiety I pursued my
search. I may sum up the whole in
stating that my uncle was not in Potosi,
and that if he had ever been there, he
had removed to some other part of the
country at least three years before.</p>

<p>At the end of two months, I expected
an answer from Valparaiso, but none was
received; and after two months more I
was forced to adopt the conclusion that
my letters had miscarried, or my correspondents
had refused to comply with
my request. My situation was again in
the highest degree embarrassing. After
revolving a great many schemes in my
mind, I determined to join a company
of merchants who were going at that
time to Quito. I offered myself as a
mule-driver, and Balbo as a servant.
Both were accepted, and we speedily
set forward. I have not space to detail
the incidents of this journey of
more than 1500 miles in length. My
story has, perhaps, already extended
beyond the patience of the reader. It
will be enough to say, that, after travelling
over mountains and plains, and
beholding some of the most sublime
scenery in the world, we reached the
capital of Equador.</p>

<p>There are few places in the world
more remarkable than Quito. It lies
nearly under the equator, yet, being more
than 9,000 feet above the level of the
sea, it has a climate like that of our
June during the whole year. The face
of nature seems to be covered with perpetual
bloom. While some of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
are sowing their wheat, others are
harvesting theirs.</p>

<p>The city of Quito is itself built upon
the skirt of the volcanic mountain of
Pichinca. It is a fine city, with many
elegant buildings, though the streets are
irregular, and arches are frequently necessary
in order to cross the yawning
chasms created by the eruptions of the
mountain.</p>

<p>In a southerly direction, at the distance
of about a hundred miles, is the
celebrated peak of Chimborazo. It is
21,440 feet in height, and is capped with
everlasting snow. In a clear day, I
could see this sublime mountain, seeming
like a thin blue cloud, and appearing
almost to blend with the distant sky.
I had now given up every hope of meeting
with my uncle, and thought only of
finding my way back to Guiana. An
opportunity was soon offered for setting
out for my return. Three Spanish travellers
were about to proceed to Assumption
on the Pilcomayo, and then descend
the Amazon to its mouth. Balbo and
myself were engaged as servants, and
we speedily set forward.</p>

<p>We crossed the mountains on mules,
sometimes employing llamas for carrying
our baggage. These animals are about
twice the size of the sheep, and have a
gentleness of character that seems to
win kindness from every one. They
have indeed one habit which seems
incompatible with their general course of
non-resistance; for if you offend them,
they will spit in your face. Yet they
cannot endure chastisement. They will
perform the utmost labor of which they
are capable; but if you strike them in
order to urge them beyond this, they
will lie down and die.</p>

<p>In a fortnight we reached the small
town of Assumpcion. We here embarked
upon the Amazon in a boat,
being liberally provided with everything
needful for our voyage.</p>

<p>After a diversity of incidents, we
reached the town of Barra, just below
the point where the Rio Negro enters
the Amazon. We here parted with our
bateau and joining some other travellers,
hired a larger craft and proceeded on
our way. The weather was exceedingly
hot, and several of our company
were taken sick, and the Spaniard in
whose service I was engaged, died of
fever. Proceeding to the shore, which
at this point was occupied with impenetrable
forests, we made a grave in the
earth, and left the body to its solitary
repose.</p>

<p>Among the strangers who had joined
us at Barra was a gentleman who
appeared marked with care and bowed
with years. He was now among the
sick, and I was engaged as his attendant.
He had caught the fever common
to this climate, and it seemed rapidly
advancing to its crisis. We had no
physician on board, but the stranger
seemed competent to give directions, and
these I scrupulously followed. At last
we came to a small settlement on the
banks of the river, and he concluded to
be set on shore, in order to obtain medical
aid, and have the comforts necessary
to his condition. I went with him to his
lodgings, and saw him placed in his new
quarters.</p>

<p>I had felt an interest in him from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
beginning, and I now offered to continue
with him, at the same time expressing
my desire to return to Paramaribo. The
name seemed to excite his curiosity, and
he looked me steadily in the face for a
moment. “Are you going to Paramaribo?”
said he. I replied in the affirmative.
“I was going thither myself,”
said he, “but I may never reach that
place. Take this, young man, and on
your arrival, deliver it according to its
address.” He then handed me a parcel,
and as I took it, I saw upon it the name
of M. Scager.</p>

<p>At this moment an agitating thought
took possession of my mind. “Who—what
is this stranger? May it not after
all be the individual whom I have sought
so long?” Struck with this suggestion,
I gazed at the sick man with such intensity
as to attract his attention. “What
is the matter, young man?” said he.
“Oh, tell me, sir, tell me your name.
For heaven’s sake tell me your name,”
said I. The stranger rose from his pillow,
and with a startled aspect demanded,
“Why this curiosity? what mean these
questions?”</p>

<p>“Pray sir,” said I, “are you not my
uncle?” The sick man leaned back
upon his pillow, and with a broad smile
upon his countenance as if I had said
something exceedingly ludicrous, replied,
“I think not; but what is your name?”
“Richard Boldhero,” said I. The stranger
once more rose from his pillow, saying,
“Indeed, indeed, Richard Boldhero?”
“Yes, yes,” said I, “and you
are my father’s brother—I know you
now—you are indeed my uncle.”</p>

<p>I need not describe the remainder of
the scene. The object of my long search
was found. For seven weeks I watched
by his bedside, during which period he
seemed hovering betwixt life and death.
By slow degrees he recovered, and in
due time we took passage down the
river, and at last reached its mouth. I
had now traversed nearly the whole
length of this giant stream—a distance
of about 3,500 miles.</p>

<p>At Mazago we took passage in a brig
for Paramaribo, and in two weeks we
reached that place. During our voyage,
my uncle gave me an account of his life
after his departure from thence. He
had settled for a time at Valparaiso, and
had acquired a considerable amount of
property. This he converted into cash,
and remitted it to Mr. Hartley, for the
purpose of discharging his debts, as we
have already related. Since that period,
he had led an unsettled life, being
engaged at different times in various
enterprises. Finding himself advancing
into the vale of years, a desire to return to
the scenes of his youth took possession of
his mind, and when I met him, he was on
his way to fulfil this wish. He had not
heard of the turn of fortune in his favor,
but considered his name as still disgraced
in Paramaribo. It may be readily
believed that the information I gave
him brought back the sunshine which
had long departed from his bosom.</p>

<p>I must pass over my own meeting
with Mirabel as well as that of her
father. The imagination of the reader
will doubtless do better justice to the
scene than any words I can supply. I had
been absent a year and eleven months,
and during that period had often suffered
the deepest anxiety for my mother
and sister. I now found letters from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
<a id="chg10"></a>well, and enjoying as much happiness as
their humble condition would permit.
In a few weeks I set out to return to
Connecticut, my uncle having promised
soon to follow me, and bring Mirabel
with him.</p>

<p>I reached home in due season, and
four months after, his promise was fulfilled.
He settled at Middletown, having
recovered a sum of money sufficient
to make him wealthy from the insurance
company that had inflicted upon
him such gross injustice and so many
sorrows. On hearing the conduct of
Dexter to my father, he caused a suit to
be instituted against him, in the course of
which, it was proved that he had been
guilty of embezzling property belonging
to the concern. He was obliged to pay
a large sum to my mother, and his own
reputation which he had built up with
such hypocritical care, was blasted forever.</p>

<p>In the course of my life, viewing the
hard fortune of my father and my uncle,
I had sometimes distrusted the justice of
Providence; but I now saw that the persecutors
of both had been made to suffer
the severest retribution. With this reflection
I must close my story, only
adding that Mirabel no longer calls me
cousin, but many years ago exchanged
that pleasant title for one of a still dearer
character.</p>

<h3 class="h3head">The Squirrel and Rattlesnake.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">R<span class="smcap">attlesnakes</span> hunt and secure for their
prey, with ease, grey squirrels that
abound in our woods; therefore, they
must be possessed of swiftness to
obtain them. Having enjoyed the pleasure
of beholding such a chase in full
view, in the year 1821, I shall detail its
circumstances:</p>

<p>Whilst lying on the ground, to watch
the habits of a bird which was new to
me, previous to shooting it, I heard a
smart rustling not far from me, and turning
my head that way, saw, at the same
moment, a grey squirrel, full grown,
issuing from the thicket, and bouncing
off in a straight direction, in leaps of several
feet at a time; and, not more than
twenty feet behind, a rattlesnake of ordinary
size, pursuing, drawn out, apparently,
to its full length, and sliding over
the ground so rapidly, that, as they both
moved away from me, I was at no loss
to observe the snake gain upon the squirrel.</p>

<p>The squirrel made for a tree, and ascended
its topmost branches as nimbly as
squirrels are known to do. The snake
performed the same task considerably
more slowly, yet so fast, that the squirrel
never raised his tail nor barked, but
eyed the enemy attentively as he mounted
and approached. When within a few
yards, the squirrel leaped to another
branch, and the snake followed by stretching
out two thirds of his body, whilst the
remainder held it securely from falling.
Passing thus from branch to branch, with
a rapidity that astonished me, the squirrel
went in and out of several holes, but
remained in none, knowing well, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
wherever his head could enter, the body
of his antagonist would follow; and, at
last, much exhausted and terrified, took a
desperate leap, and came to the earth
with legs and tail spread to their utmost,
to ease the fall. That instant the snake
dropped also, and was within a few yards
of the squirrel before it began making
off.</p>

<p>The chase on land again took place,
and ere the squirrel could reach another
tree, the snake had seized it by the back,
near the occiput, and soon rolled itself
about it in such a way, that although I
heard the cries of the victim, I scarcely
saw any portion of its body. So full of
its ultimate object was the snake, that it
paid no attention to me, and I approached
it to see in what manner it would dispose
of its prey. A few minutes elapsed,
when I saw the reptile loosening gradually
and opening its folded coils, until the
squirrel was entirely disengaged, having
been killed by suffocation. The snake
then raised its body from the ground,
and passed its head over the dead animal
in various ways, to assure itself that
life had departed; it then took the end
of the squirrel’s tail, swallowed it gradually;
bringing first one and then the
other of the hind legs parallel with it,
and sucked with difficulty, and for some
time, at them and the rump of the animal,
until its jaws became so expanded,
that, after this, it swallowed the whole
remaining parts with apparent ease.</p>

<p>This mass of food was removed several
inches from the head in the stomach
of the snake, and gave it the appearance
of a rouleau of money in a purse
with both ends towards its centre; for,
immediately after the operation of swallowing
was completed, the jaws and neck
resumed their former appearance. The
snake then attempted to move off, but
this was next to impossible; when, having
cut a twig, I went up to it, and tapped
it on the head, which it raised, as well
as its tail, and began for the first time to
rattle. I was satisfied that, for some
lapse of time, it could not remove far,
and that the woods being here rather
thin, it would soon become the victim of
a vulture. I then killed it, and cut it
open, to see how the squirrel lay within.</p>

<p>I had remarked that after the process
of swallowing was completed, singular
movements of the body had taken place;
a kind of going to and fro for a while,
not unlike the convulsive motions of a
sick animal, as a dog, for instance, going
to vomit. I concluded that some internal
and necessary operation was going
on. This was proved, when I found the
squirrel lying perfectly smooth, even to
its hair, from its nose to the tip of its tail.
I noted all this on the spot. This over,
I sought my game again, and felt a great
satisfaction; but having met my friend,
Mr. James Perry, on whose lands, in
Louisiana, I was then hunting, and having
related what had just happened, he laughingly
said, “Why, my dear sir, I could
have told you this long ago, it being nothing
new to me.” These facts, I trust, are
quite sufficient to exemplify the faculties
of swiftness, and the powers of extension
and diminution, in the rattlesnake.—<cite>Mr.

<h3 class="h3head">There is Time Enough.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> is one of the most mischievous
sentences in the English language.
Not that it is bad in itself—for it is
strictly true, as we intend to show
presently. But its meaning is sadly
perverted, and what was meant for good,
becomes the occasion of evil.</p>

<p>Many a good thing might have been
done had it been begun in season; but
because there was time enough, it was
let alone, and let alone, and so not started
until too late, or never moved at all.</p>

<p>But there is such a thing as bringing
good out of evil. The bee extracts
honey, as sweet, if not as abundant,
from the thistle, as from the rose. And
he who would profit by studying human
nature, and watching divine providence,
may learn wisdom from his past errors,
and turn over his misfortune to some
good account.</p>

<p>The wisest man in ancient days, (and
we believe he was fully as wise as people
commonly are at present,)—the
wisest man of ancient days has given us
to understand that there is <em>a time</em> for
everything under the sun. <cite>A time for
laughter and for tears, for sorrow and
for joy.</cite> A time for business, a time
for recreation, and a time for rest; but
he does not say a word about leisure
time, or time for idleness. He speaks
too of a time to die, leaving us to infer,
as we may very naturally, that He, <em>who
made the sun to rule the day</em>, the moon
and stars to govern the night, has given
us <em>time enough</em>, just time enough, and
none to spare, to perform all our duties,
and to enjoy every rational pleasure—to
make the world better for our having
lived in it, and to become better fitted ourselves,
for “another and a better world.”</p>

<p>There is <em>time enough</em>, says the schoolboy;
whose time runs out, and he goes
half fitted to the counting room, or enters
half fitted at college.</p>

<p><em>Time enough</em>, thinks many a young
man, if he does not say so, to commence
habits of frugality and economy, and
thus provide for future wealth; but the
time never, never comes, and he, to use
a homely phrase of Dr. Franklin’s,
“scratches a poor man’s head as long
as he lives.”</p>

<p>How many designs have we formed,
of doing this and that good thing, which
fell through, not because we had little
time, but because we had time enough,
and so wasted one hour after another till
the time had passed.</p>

<p>Time enough to work says the idler
and spendthrift; but his clothes wear out
before he finds time to earn new ones;
and his pockets are emptied, and he has
no time to replenish them.</p>

<p>Franklin has a homely saying to this
effect,—that he who loses an hour in the
morning, must run all day, and ’tis a
wonder if he overtakes his business before
night. So, if any one finds himself
pinched for time, it is likely he has
thrown away an hour, when he thought
he had time enough and a little to spare.</p>

<p><em>Time enough</em>—say we, when in a
serious mood we resolve to be more diligent,
more systematic, more punctual;

<p>We do not mean to procrastinate; but

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
No doubt of it. Yet we are apt to
think there is not only <em>time enough</em>, but
some to spare.</p>

<p>But this is an error, and should be
corrected.</p>

<p>The different length of different lives
is nothing against our position, that life
is just long enough. The oldest person
has enough of duty and enough of pleasure
too, if he lives aright, to occupy his
threescore years and ten, while he whose
sun goes down at noon, has time enough,
if he will but improve it, to make his life
here a blessing to others, and that hereafter
blessed and glorious to himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Folly of War.</span>—A few days
since a farmer in the town of Jefferson,
heard loud talking and angry words bandied
about among his dunghill fowls, and
being a man of a pacific disposition, no
ways inclined to countenance family
quarrels, and withal being a little curious
to know the cause of the disturbance,
and who was in the right, and who was
in the wrong, with divers other causes
him thereunto moving, he leisurely bent
his course towards the scene of cackling
and confusion, aforesaid, which, as is
recorded in the case of Bullum <i>vs.</i> Boatum,
was “very natural for a man so to
do.” Arrived in the vicinity of the disturbance
above particularly referred to,
he observed his dunghill cock, who is a
great pugilist, and in the enjoyment of
all his physical strength, engaged in mortal
combat with a striped snake of about
eighteen or twenty inches in length, the
cock to all appearance having the decided
advantage over his more wily, though
less nervous adversary, dealing his blows
in quick succession, employing alternately
his bill and spurs with true pugilistic
skill and science. But the cunning
serpent, well aware that the victory must
declare against him by fair combat,
brought into requisition a portion of that
innate cunning for which that reptile has
been celebrated from the beginning of
the world to the present time; and seizing
his antagonist by the thigh, in the
rear, he completely secured himself from
any further danger from him. Thus situated,
the cock very naturally thought
his only “safety was in flight,” he accordingly
“cleaved the air majestically with
his wings,” the snake keeping fast the
hold, and dangling like a taglock, underneath,
until the cock, overcome by fatigue,
alighted on a neighboring apple tree.
The snake immediately coiled his tail
around a branch of the tree—the cock
again attempted flight, but he could
scarcely clear the limb, from which he
hung with his head downwards, making
every effort to escape, but all in vain,
until the farmer came to his assistance—killed
the snake and set him at liberty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wager Lost.</span>—In the year 1765, a
waterman having laid a wager that he
and his dog would both leap from the
centre arch of Westminster bridge, and
land at Lambeth within a minute of
each other; he jumped off first and the
dog immediately followed, but not being
in the secret, and fearing that his master
would be drowned, he laid hold of him
by the neck and dragged him on shore,
to the great diversion of the spectators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
<span class="smcap">Anecdote of a Cat.</span>—Sometime ago
a respectable lady from Glasgow, having
been on a visit at the house of a friend
in Edinburgh, fancied a beautiful cat of
the Muscovy species, which graced the
fireside of the hostess. The latter, being
pressingly solicited, at length consented
to present her visiter with the animal,
and puss was accordingly enclosed in a
basket, and transported along with her
new proprietrix in the inside of a carriage
to the city of Glasgow. For seven
or eight weeks after the animal’s arrival
at her new residence, she was watched,
lest, not being reconciled to the change,
she should make her escape.</p>

<p>At the termination of that time, she
littered two kittens; and this circumstance
was considered a sufficient guarantee
for her remaining, for some weeks
at least, in her new house. Some days
afterwards, however, puss with both her
kittens disappeared, and no traces could
be obtained of the place to which she
had been removed, until about eight days
from the time of her disappearance from
her Glasgow residence, when her well-known
mew was recognized by her former
mistress at the door of her drawing
room. The door was opened; and there
was seen poor puss with her brace of
kittens—they in excellent condition—but
she worn to a skeleton. The distance
betwixt Edinburgh and Glasgow is
upwards of forty miles; and as the sagacious
animal could only carry one of her
kittens such a distance at a time, she
must, after having placed the one, in
someplace of concealment in Edinburgh,
have returned to Glasgow for the other—thus
travelling altogether upwards of one
hundred and twenty miles. There is no
doubt but puss chose the darkness and
silence of the night as the most eligible
season for the performance of her singular
journey.</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">Examination of a School Boy.</span>—The
following anecdote illustrates the danger
of trusting to memory alone, in the acquisition
of knowledge.</p>

<p>“Now, my boy,” said the master,
“pray inform me who was the first man
in the world?” “Adam,” replied the
youth, with quickness.</p>

<p>So far so good; the next attempt was
not equally fortunate. “And pray, who
was the <em>wisest</em> man in the world?”
“Eve,” replied the boy, with a triumphant
air; at which all the boys burst into
a loud fit of laughter, which the authority
of the master calling silence, could
not suppress for some minutes.</p>

<p>“You mistook the question, my boy,”
said the master; “you imagined, no
doubt, that I asked who was the wisest
<em>woman</em> in the world; and to that question
your answer is very accurate; for, as
Eve was the <em>first</em> woman in the world,
she must at that time have also been the
<em>wisest</em>.”</p>

<p>But the mortified pupil was too much
disturbed by the laughter of his schoolfellows
to avail himself of this ingenious
hint. He appealed to the ready-made
answers of his catechism, to prove that
his master alone was the cause of his
distress.</p>

<p>“Look there; question fourth, ‘Who
was the first woman in the world?’ answer,
‘Eve;’ but instead of that, when
I expected question fourth, you asked
question fifth, that you did!”</p>

<span class="smcap">A Sly Couple.</span>—A gentleman in the
county of Stirling kept a greyhound and
a pointer, and being fond of coursing,
the pointer was accustomed to find the
hares, and the greyhound to catch them.
When the season was over it was found
that the dogs were in the habit of going
out together and killing hares for their
own amusement. To prevent this a large
iron ring was fastened to the pointer’s
neck by a leather collar and hung down
so as to prevent the dog from running, or
jumping over dykes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The animals, however, continued to
stroll out to the fields together, and one
day the gentleman suspecting that all
was not right, resolved to watch them,
and to his surprise found that the moment
they thought they were unobserved,
the greyhound took up the iron ring in
his mouth, and carrying it they set off
to the hills and began to search for hares
as usual. They were followed and it
was observed, that whenever the pointer
scented the hare, the ring was dropped
and the greyhound stood ready to pounce
upon poor puss the moment the other
drove her from her form, but that he uniformly
returned to assist his companion
after he had caught the prey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Philosopher Puzzled.</span>—De la
Croix relates the following instance of
sagacity in a cat, which, even under the
receiver of an air pump, discovered the
means of escaping a death that appeared
to all present inevitable.</p>

<p>“I once saw,” says he, “a lecturer upon
experimental philosophy place a cat under
the glass receiver of an air pump,
for the purpose of demonstrating that
very certain fact, that life cannot be supported
without air and respiration. The
lecturer had already made several strokes
with the piston, in order to exhaust the
receiver of its air, when the animal, that
had begun to feel herself very uncomfortable
in the rarefied atmosphere, was
fortunate enough to discover the source
from whence her uneasiness proceeded.
She placed her paw upon the hole through
which the air escaped, and thus prevented
any more from passing out of the receiver.</p>

<p>“All the exertions of the officer were
now unavailing; in vain he drew the
piston; the cat’s paw effectually prevented
its operation. Hoping to effect
his purpose, he let air again into the
receiver, which as soon as the cat perceived,
she withdrew her paw from the
aperture; but when he attempted to exhaust
the receiver, she applied her paw
as before. All the spectators clapped
their hands in admiration of the wonderful
sagacity of the animal, and the lecturer
found himself under the necessity
of liberating her, and substituting another
in her place, that possessed less penetration,
and enabled him to exhibit the cruel
experiment.”—<cite>Naturalist.</cite></p>

this the figure nine, or the figure seven?”
He was told that it was the figure seven,
“Well then,” said the genius, “it lacks
just about half an inch of eight.”</p>

<span class="smcap">The French Officer and his Mastiff.</span>—A
French officer, more remarkable
for his courage and spirit than his
wealth, had served the Venetian republic
for some years with great valor and
fidelity, but had not met with that preferment
which he merited. One day he
waited on a nobleman whom he had often
solicited in vain, but on whose friendship
he had still some reliance. The reception
he met with was cool and mortifying;
the nobleman turned his back upon the
necessitous veteran, and left him to find
his way through a suit of apartments
magnificently furnished. He passed them
lost in thought; till casting his eyes on
a sumptuous sideboard, where a valuable
collection of Venetian glass, polished and
formed in the highest degree of perfection,
stood on a damask cloth, as a preparation
for a splendid entertainment, he
took hold of a corner of the linen, and
turning to a faithful English mastiff
which always accompanied him, said to
the animal, in a kind of absence of mind,
“Here, my poor old friend, you see how
these haughty tyrants indulge themselves,
and yet how we are treated.”</p>

<p>The dog looked his master in the face
and gave tokens that he understood him.
The master walked on, but the mastiff
<a id="chg3"></a>slackened his pace, and laying hold of the
damask cloth with his teeth, at one hearty
pull brought all the glass on the sideboard
in shivers to the ground, thus
depriving the insolent noble of his favorite
exhibition of splendor.</p>

Sparta, anciently <i>Laconia</i>. Lycurgus,
the lawgiver, exercised the young people
in conversation while at their meals.
Questions were asked them at the table,
to which short and ready answers were
required. This was both the amusement
and business of old men, and great attention
was paid by those who watched
over education, both to the expression
and manner of these replies. The boys,
accustomed to have their answers listened
to, corrected and applauded by men for
whom they had the greatest esteem, acquired
a quickness and propriety in answering,
with a manner of speaking, at
once graceful, respectful, and determined;
while that strict obedience which was
required of the young, that watchful eye
that was kept over them by the aged, in
whose hands all the authority of the laws
was placed, produced that modesty in
youth, and that reverence for age, for
which Sparta became so famous.</p>

parrot, asked him “Are you worth one

“What doubt is there of that?” The
Mogul was delighted and bought the
bird. He soon found out that it was all
he could say. Ashamed now of his bargain,
he one day exclaimed, “I was a fool
to buy this bird.” The parrot replied,
“What doubt is there of that?”</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Mount Vernon.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">his</span> name does not mean a town or
village, but an estate, which was for
many years the residence of Washington.
We give above, a view of
the house, which still remains, though
it is a good deal dilapidated since it was
inhabited by the great and good man to
whom it owes its celebrity.</p>

<p>Mount Vernon is a large farm, near
the Potomac, and lies about eight or ten
miles below Alexandria, in the District
of Columbia. The house is an old-fashioned
one, of ample size, with a deep
piazza in front. It commands a view of
the river and surrounding country, and
is a very pleasant spot. But its chief
interest lies in the fact that here was the
house of Washington, and that good,
hospitable companion of his fortunes,
lady Washington.</p>

<p>Many people, from all parts of the
world, visit this place every year, and
as they walk over the grounds, and tread
the halls of the mansion, the image of
the father of his country arises before the
fancy, and the stranger seems to realize
the scenes that have long since passed
away. What a power there is in greaness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
and goodness, to impart an interest
to everything that has been associated
with those who, in life, displayed these
noble qualities; and in death, have left
behind a name and fame, which it is the
delight of mankind to cherish!</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Nine Tailors make a Man.</span>”—This
sentence, which had its origin in the
grateful mind of one who had received
a start in life from the charity of tailors,
has now, from an ignorance of the circumstance,
entirely lost its meaning.
The term had its origin in the following
manner.</p>

<p>In 1742, an orphan beggar boy applied
for alms at a fashionable tailor’s shop
in London, in which nine journeymen
were employed. His interesting and
forlorn appearance touched the hearts of
the benevolent tailors, who immediately
contributed nine shillings for the relief
of the little stranger. With this capital,
our young hero purchased fruit, which
he retailed at profit. From this beginning,
by industry and perseverance, he
finally rose to wealth and distinction, and
when he set up his carriage, he caused
to be painted on the pannel, “Nine tailors
made me a man.”</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">Socrates.</span>—It is said of Socrates, the
great Grecian philosopher, that he never
allowed his temper to overcome him, but
displayed the utmost tranquillity on all
occasions. Feeling at one time displeased
with one of his servants, he
said, “I would beat thee, if I were not
angry.”</p>

<hr class="short">
<p>The word “<em>gentleman</em>,” is evidently
no mark of wealth or station. “You
are no gentleman,” said a waiter in a
tavern to a person who had given him
three-pence. Three-pence more would
have constituted the gentleman in the
eyes of the waiter, while in truth the
three-pence might have been withheld
through poverty.</p>

<p>“What sort of a person,” said an individual
to his landlady, “is that who occupies
your back parlor?” “He is a
tailor by trade,” said she, “but very much
the gentleman.” This meant that he
paid his five shillings a week regularly!</p>

<hr class="short">
<p><span class="smcap">A Sailor in a Coach.</span>—Sailors are
favorites, from a general belief in their
superior frankness and gallantry; but an
early association with tar and oakum is
by no means calculated to purify the
taste or give the manners the highest
finish. We shall not easily forget the
sensation once produced by the arrival of
a distinguished naval officer at an archery
meeting in England; he was pleased to
descend the steps of his carriage stern
foremost, as if he were descending an
accommodation ladder!</p>

of the parson.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">e</span> have came to the close of another
year and another volume. In the
opposite picture, we see old <a id="note2"></a><b>1844</b>
going down into the abyss of the
<span class="allsmcap">PAST</span>, while the new year, like a youth
upon his sled at the top of the hill, is
ready to begin his race. The grisly image
of Time is standing by, marking the
flight of years, and notching down the
ineffaceable record upon the cold gray
rock of eternity.</p>

<p>Well—so it is—so it must be. “Time
and tide will wait for no man.” The
world rolls round, and what mortal can
stay its revolutions? Let us be careful
then, to see that this most precious of
gifts be diligently and wisely used. If
we have spent our time well, we have no
reason to lament its departure: if we
have used it amiss—if we have squandered
it in the pursuit of folly, or used
it in the indulgence of sin—then, then
indeed we have reason to mourn over its
irreparable loss. But the moment we
are aware of such an error, let us arrest
our downward progress; adopt new and
wise resolves, that we may reclaim the
loss of the past, as far as may be, by the
more diligent and faithful use of the
future.</p>

<p>And while we talk to others, let not
Bob Merry forget his own duty. For
the last twelve months, we have plodded
on, bringing forth things new and old,
to the best of our feeble ability, in fulfilment
of our vocation, which is to please
and profit our gentle friends and readers.
That we have done well, we cannot presume
to say; that we have intended well,
is all we can venture to assume. Amid
the cares and toils of our journey,—the
flaws, cross-currents, and tempests of our
voyage—we have at least one comfort—perhaps
but one—and that is, that our
little Black Eyes and Blue are still
good-humored, and still cheer us with
their confidence and favor. This joyous
breeze still fills our sails—and with this
encouragement we shall start upon the
voyage of 1845.</p>

<p>We hope to perform every trip this
year, under some new advantages. We
not only retain our old publishers,
Messrs. Bradbury, Soden &amp; Co.,—who
commenced the Museum and have carried
it on so successfully through eight
volumes—but we have taken on board a
new captain,—D. Mead of New York,
who is an experienced sailor, and who
intends to make a dashing voyage. To
drop the metaphor, and speak in plain
language—the Museum is hereafter to
be issued from two points—the office of
Bradbury, Soden &amp; Co., <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12 School
street, Boston, and that of the aforesaid
D. Mead, 148 Nassau street, New York.
The work will appear with promptitude,
and we shall be careful to see that, every
month, the patrons of the work shall find a
palatable assortment of literary varieties.
We shall still be happy to receive the
favors of our correspondents, addressed
to Bradbury, Soden &amp; Co., 12 School St.,
Boston.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
